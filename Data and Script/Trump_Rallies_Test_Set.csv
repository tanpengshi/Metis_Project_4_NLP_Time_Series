8,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Campaign Rally in Macon, Georgia ",October 16 2020,"I love Georgia here, do I love being with you. This is Georgia. This is Macon, Georgia. We won Macon, Georgia, we're going to win it again, it's great to be back in honor of this incredible state, with the thousands of loyal, hardworking, unbelievable American patriots. Thank you very much. And 18 days from now, we're going to win the state of Georgia, we're going to win four more years. Ain't that beautiful and incredible in so many ways that beautiful White House, right? And just remember, early voting is underway, get out and vote go out and vote. So we're running against, perhaps, the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. Can you believe this? Did you watch last night? I mean, give me a break, but actually, I wish he was a good candidate cause it actually puts more pressure on you running against a guy like this. Sleepy Joe Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt political class that enriched himself while draining the economic life and soul from our country. You know what's happened, you know very well in Georgia what happened. For the last 47 years, Joe Biden, shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders, and ravage our cities, while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless and ridiculous foreign wars, in places you've never even heard of before, how ridiculous. He's a servant of the wealthy donors, globalists, and special interests who got rich bleeding America dry. And by the way, I could call these guys, every one of them would give me millions. I'm president, I called heads of Wall Street firms, I'd say, hey, do me a favor, could you give me five million., every single one. I can't do that, though, because you know what, if I do that, I get to do things for them and I don't want to do -- I want to do what's right. I could call, I could raise money. I can raise more money, I'd be the world's greatest fundraiser, but I just don't want to do it because when they call you and you sort of say, hey, you know they treated me good. I got to treat them good. I know you don't think that's the way the system works, but that's the way the system, I guess, works, unfortunately. But it doesn't work that way for me. In 2016, you voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president to finally put America first. And we've learned over the last couple of months, Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, he's a corrupt politician, and the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. Frankly, it makes Crooked Hillary Clinton look like an amateur. Now, whoever saw anything like this? He goes to China, the kid has followed like a vacuum cleaner, he follows him, follows him, followed and unfortunately, it sounds like he left his laptop behind him, they have thousands. This is a guy, didn't have a job and now he's taking in millions, and plenty of it goes to Joe Biden too. Don't kid yourself. It goes to Joe, but did you see the one today? The guy gets 10%, 10%. I wonder who the guy is. This was not a good -- between Anthony Weiner's laptop and this laptop, these are two beauties. I think this one could be worse than the winner laptop. Yet this massive scandal is being covered up by the media and big tech, right, all those people, look at those. [Audience Boos] So here we have -- think of it, here we have the biggest scandal going on anywhere in the world, the corruption of Joe Biden and the Biden family, and he's interviewed last night by a Stephanopoulos on ABC and they don't even ask him the question about it. No, no, think of it. They don't even ask him a question like, you know, like, how come your son got $3.5 million from Moscow? right, from Moscow. Russia. Because they were the ones involved with Russia, turns out not me, it was the opposite. But why did your son get three and a half million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow? Think of it, think of it. Little question like that. Remember Chris Wallace said, oh well, you should ask him that question. Why, no, why is that, Chris? Tell me., he's no Mike, he's no Mike. Chris is no Mike, but then the other one, how about this: a billion dollars, get rid of the prosecutor, otherwise, you don't get the billion dollars from the United States, but that's turning out to be peanuts compared to what we're finding now. Now he wants $10 million from China to make an introduction. Would anybody here take $10 million to introduce somebody to your father? I'd do it. Dad, I'd do it for 10 million bucks, I'd love to introduce. I would do it, pop. And he'd want me to do a 10 million, Dad, please. I had a great father. I'm not just running against Biden in that corrupt family, I'm running against the left-wing corrupt media and we're running against big tech. [Audience Boos] [Audience chants ""We Love Trump""] Here's a hell of a big crowd, by the -- Look at that, it goes all the way, but you know the media, they never show it. You ever notice you go home, they show me and about three people behind me, people left and right. Four stars, hey end up three plus one. [Audience chants ""We Love Trump""] Thank you very much. You know it's very -- I love that, but no politician, I believe, has ever heard that chant, really, we love somebody. No, think of it, Reagan, I loved Reagan, he was a wonderful guy. You never heard the chant ""We love Reagan!"", you never heard that. This started a few weeks ago and it's amazing and I appreciate it very much, I do, I appreciate it. I have to say, and I love this state, I love Georgia. You know when you had the hurricane overdrive where it came in and wiped out a lot of your area, David Perdue is a fantastic guy, who may be here someplace. But David Perdue called me, he said, you gotta do me a favor. You gotta help us with our farmers., and we gave them a hell of a lot of money. We helped. They got wiped out by a hurricane. You know you don't hit too many hurricanes right, but this was a big monster that hit Florida. hit a lot of different areas, hit Alabama. We took care of Alabama, we took care of Georgia, we took care of Georgia, took care of our farmers. I'll never forget, I stood, I came here and I stood and I was with 32 farmers, all of whom got hit hard and one of them said, sir, I was a week away from having the best crop I've ever had and it got ripped apart, just ripped apart. It wasn't his fault and we took care of him. We took care of all of them. OK. It made me feel good. It made me feel good. Great people and they never asked for anything. They just want a level playing field, that's all they ever wanted. And I raised, by the way, 28 million, thank you, China because they targeted our farmers, 12 billion, and then the next year, $16 billion. Frankly, you did better without even working, if you want to know the truth, it came from China, and we did a hell of a job and those farmers are all happy today, but they were targeted by China, we've got $28 billion in tariffs and we gave it to your farmers and everybody's doing just fine today, right? But the radical left is doing everything in their power to protect their chosen candidate, who has no clue where he is, he's gone. They have nothing but disdain for you and for your values and the values of Georgia. I know Georgia very well. They flood your communities with criminal aliens, with drugs, crime, while leaving behind, and you see what they do, they live in gated communities but they flood you out. They complain about guns and they complain about everything and then they want to end your second amendment, but they want protection for themselves. They oppose school choice while sending their families to the best private schools. We need school choice, by the way, they demonize our great [Inaudible], and you know you see this -- Hello, look, how beautiful, so beautiful. They demonize our great police and law enforcement while hiring private security for themselves. They attack the Second Amendment every single day while employing armed guards, and let me tell you, I am the only thing standing in the way of you and your Second Amendment. It's undersea, that's a big deal. They support crippling lockdowns, while their jobs remain totally exempt. It's time we sent a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites. I could have every one of them. By the way, I mean, just like I said before, I can go -- I know these guys, I can call them all, they do me a favor, Irving, send me 5 million. OK, I'll do it. Donald, don't do it, if you want it, oh man, I gotta do it. Do you mind if I take one week to just do it? I will set the all-time record on fundraising. Man, would I be good at that, it's so easy. I wouldn't have to explain a thing. But they come from Washington, they come from New York, they come from Silicon Valley, and by the way, those Silicon Valley guys are sort of getting caught, aren't they huh? Section 230, I'm sure most of you don't know what that means, Section 230. These guys, they're given powers, they're given rights by Washington, and then they claim free speech, right. They claim, but no, but they're giving an exemption. They given a total exemption and they can't abuse that power and there's a lot of things going on right now and a lot of Europe people are looking. We have some of those people here, you're great congressmen, senators, and we'll be introducing them in a second but they're looking very hard at Section 230. On Election Day, you can send a message that the fake news media right there -- boy, there are a lot of them. Look at that, looks like the Academy Awards, that's a lot of people. [Audience Boos] There are a lot of people. Look at those cameras are running with those red lights, but every time I mentioned their name, those red lights go off. You know the red lights, that means you're live, and then you start talking about -- they say, get the lights off. Turn it off. Go to a break. Let's go to a break right now."" That fake news, CNN, they don't know what -- They are so fake. They really are. They're just disgusting. NBC is no better. Did you get to see last night? Yeah? Did a good job, but look, I mean, I could've had somebody else, they're all the same. I mean, they ask you a question, you give them an answer, right? But I want to tell you that she's, like, disappeared. Everybody thought it was so inappropriate. Here they give this guy softballs. Did you see a week ago, Lester Holt, Lester Holt, another genius. Lester Holt. Here's -- Mr. Vice President, sir, what did you have for dinner, sir? Was it good? And in Savannah, It was like her face, the anger, the craziness, I mean, the craziness last night. And I said goodbye. I said great job, Savannah. You did wonderfully good job. But we got very high marks for that last night, but they thought it was very unfair that -- that Sleepy Joe, who cannot answer a question, he really can't answer a question. Well, Chris Wallace protected him with me. I talked about the Moscow three and a half million families. I talked about the billion dollars, Chris Wallace wouldn't let -- He said. No, that's an appropriate. Why? You mean the guys allowed to take three and half a million bucks that we're not allowed to talk to him about it? I'm telling you, that Biden family, and others, but that Biden family is corrupt. It's a corrupt family. And with me and my kids -- Let me tell you, my kids -- I'll tell you something though, it was very -- Lock them up. You should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary. [Audience chants ""Lock them up""] Lock them up. Can you imagine if my kids did what this guy Hunter is doing? Ivanka, oh my beautiful, my wonderfully Ivanka, she's an inno -- she's a good kid. Can you imagine? And you know she's much smarter, much sharper. She could if she wanted to, how could she do well. And Don and Eric and Tiffany, they're just -- they're just good kids. But you know we don't do things, we don't -- it's like, boy, they'd make a fortune. Just think of it. And when you look at what they get away with -- and by the way, Biden's brother tried that one. I won't go too deep in the family, I'm not looking to insult everybody, but honestly, in my opinion, it's a criminal enterprise. It's a criminal enterprise. He's like a vacuum cleaner, if the father goes through and the son comes in a vacuum cleaner, millions of dollars pouring in. Take a look at the way they live. Forty-seven years he's a politician, it was very well, almost as well as Maxine Waters. You ever see her house? Maxine. Maxine Waters. What a beautiful house she lives in. I wonder how that happened. On Election Day, you can send a message that the fake news media can't get away with it any longer. We can't let them get away with it any longer. And these big tech companies. You know, it's funny because I've heard about the big tech companies, I didn't care too much and I heard the power was unbelievable and it's like 99% for the other side, and I kept hearing about big tech, the power, the power, the power I ran, I kept hearing it. You know what they'll in one ear out the other, but I kept hearing -- and we won so I kept hearing after that. We won -- and I said, well, wait a minute. If they're so powerful, how come we won? right. They were 100% against us, but now it's gotten worse and worse and now they've gone crazy. They've gone crazy. How about our magnificent Caylee, right? So Caylee -- I don't know what the word would be, I guess, suspended, but they suspended her account because she posted an article from the New York Post, which is one of the largest papers in the country which, by the way, I want to thank them. They -- the one paper, they've really got guts, they're printing this stuff, they're gonna be making a fortune as much as they can make in that industry nowadays. But you know, when you look at the failing New York Times and The Washington Post, they don't want to write about it. They don't want to write it. This is the biggest political scandal. No, I'm sorry it's the second biggest political scandal. The biggest political scandal, we caught them, that's when they spied on our campaign and tried to take down your president. But this is the second biggest political scandal. These are a bunch of bad people. And you think it's fun doing what I do, right? No, I had a great life. I want to tell you, I was doing well, I was having a lot of fun, but you know what, I would never give up what we've achieved. Think of what we've achieved, I mean, honestly, there are a lot of successful people. There are a lot of people, they're success -- We've got a lot of them right here. A lot of successful people, but nobody in first three and a half years, nobody, first three and a half years, nobody has achieved, in the history of our country, what we've achieved with our military, with our tax cuts, with our regulations. With all the things that we've done, nobody has done as much as we've done. Things like Right to Try, things like Space Force. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] Thank you very much. You know I always get them. I said turn the cameras turn on the cameras, so we just left Florida. We had a crowd that was like, like this it was massive, it went on forever. I said, turn the cameras, show the crowd. They don't realize it's actually good for them, because it's exciting, it's like being in a Florida State, Florida, Ohio State, if you want to say, it's a massive football game. You know before we had a socially distance, we have all these empty seats right, you'll be back very soon. You'll be what? Back very soon, but -- and then, of course, Georgia, not bad, you're doing OK. And who is the greatest of them all from Georgia? Who's the greatest of them all from Georgia? Herschel. Herschel. By the way, how good was Herschel Walker? Right. He made a lot of quarterbacks look good, here, Herschel, run it. Boom! Six yards, nine yards, 10 yards, 100 yards and he's on our side and he's an incredible guy, Herschel Walker. I remember when he was playing here, they had like the ballot, the ballot to Herschel Walker. He was like just a legendary guy. Remember? From the time me started, just boom, six yards, eight yards, 10 yards, and then the quarterback goes, he says, I think I'm gonna sign with the NFL. It's like amazing, but Hershel has been great and Herschel loves this state and the fact that we have his endorsement so strongly, I mean, so strongly, we love it. But what a great football player he was, what a great winner. We want to thank Herschel. The ballot to Herschel Walker. On November 3rd, show the people the great American people that were in charge, that we're delivering Sleepy Joe Biden and that whole group of radical-left crazies, and by the way, he's not really radical left but he's got no choice. He's got absolutely nothing going. They're running the party. How about Kamala? Kamala. [Audience Boos] How good did Mike Pence do? so? How good did Mike Pence do a week ago against Kamala? That was easy. Mike is great, he's doing a great job and he really did, he did a great job, but it's very unfair, you know, it's so unfair. When you watch -- when you watch -- OK, you watch last night and you see the anger and the hatred I'm saying, look, let's just do this thing, just take it easy, relax. Just relax, take it nice and easy, OK. OK. She said, But I told you that's true. I told I said, I don't believe you. why would I believe you? You know, you see that when she's screaming? I said, well, who told me? I told you. I said, who cares if you told me. What are you telling me?"", but we got very high marks. But compare that -- Could you imagine if Joe Biden was treated like Savannah Guthrie treated us, not me, it's us? Could you imagine? He would be freaked out, he would probably be under the table. He would be under the table. And she's easy compared to President Xi and Putin and Kim Jong-un and plenty of others, she's like easy pickings. But could you imagine if she came at him? Did you see -- Now, I was interviewed a couple of weeks by -- by George Stephanopoulos and it was a tough interview but it was fine, I don't say, like, you know, give me the answers and the questions. Do you ever see where they ask him a question and then he starts reading, that means he has the answers to -- I never saw anything like what's going on in my entire life. They asked -- How about -- Did you see that, a week ago he said, move it up [Inaudible] close, I can't read the damn answer. They -- This is the fake news, I've been saying it. I am so proud of the fact that I've exposed these people for what they are. It's true. Look at all that equipment. That's millions of dollars worth of equipment. And you know what, if they were truthful, our country would come together so fast, it's so true. They're a big part of the problem. I was saying today, I was telling when I was in Florida, I was telling the story that you know, our people, we're going to bring it all together, and they said, how are you going to do it? Through success. Because we were ready. We had the most successful economy we've ever had. We never had an economy, African-American, Hispanic- American, Asian-American, women, people with high school diplomas, people without high school diplomas, people from M.I.T., top of their class, geniuses, businesses, chemical engineers, everybody was doing better than they've ever done, and then we had the plague sent to us By China, we're not going to forget that, we're not going to forget that, we're not going to forget it and they know we're not going to forget it. They know damn well that we're not going to forget it. And now we're -- we close it down, we save millions of lives. They don't say that, you know, we're over 200,000, that's terrible, but compared to other nations, it's -- it's amazing what we've been able to do, but we saved millions. It was supposed to be 2.2 million lives, right, and we saved millions of lives and now we're rebuilding it back and our economy is setting records. What we're doing is setting record. But if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician is because I'm not a politician. And if I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment and it would make, you know, it would make my life a lot easier to be honest, I know how to play those roles. Remember they used to say -- and I used to play the game about acting presidential life -- smart guy, won't let a smart people here, I'm smart.I'm -- I always said it's much easier to be presidential than to do what I do, right, remember? And I said, I'm more presidential if I wanted to be, but I got to get things done, I don't have enough time, so many stupid things that happened with bad deals, stupid deals, bad trade deals, but do remember I used to go and would have fun, but I used to go and I'd imitate a president who's playing presidential. That's so easy compared to what we do. What we do is much more difficult. I said, I can be more presidential than any president in our history, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln when he wore the hat. That was tough to beat. That was tough to beat. But you remember, I do it, we had fun with it. We'd say, ladies and gentlemen of Georgia, this is your president and it is a great honor to be with you tonight. Things are going very well with our country. Our military is building -- You know, so I could do that and you know within about three minutes, everybody would pick up and say, let's get that hell out of here, this guy's -- No, we're doing a great job. We're renegotiating these horrible trade deals, we're bringing our people back home, our soldiers, our great heroes. Because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder for you than any president has ever fought for the people of this country. [Audience chants ""USA""] Thank you very much. [Audience chants ""USA""] Thank you. By the way, I have to tell you this, the spirit in this country is unbelievable, the spirit in these rallies are unbelievable. And you know, hey, we're in Minnesota, we're going to win Minnesota. You know Minnesota, I think, hasn't been won since 1972. We're going to win Minnesota, we're going to win Minnesota. Opened up the iron ore. We opened up areas of Minnesota that they closed. In Maine, Obama took away 5,000 square miles of ocean. Can you believe it? I gave it back to the people of Maine. We're doing things that nobody's -- nobody's ever thought about doing, ever done. We went into -- you take a look at -- take a look at Minneapolis. The place was burning down, the National Guard goes in, 30 minutes would you say, remember they form that beautiful scene after watching this for a week and a half, and we want to do it with Portland. Portland would be so easy, wise guys, they're just wise guys, these are wise guys. And their, you know there the one guy who killed somebody in the street, took him three days to arrest, I sent in the U.S. marshals you know, 15 minutes later it was over. I said why hasn't that guy been -- They all knew who, they were putting his picture up. I said why hasn't he been arrested? Well, sir, they haven't -- I said, really. We got another day, we send in the U.S .marshals, in 15 minutes -- We had the greatest law enforcement people in the world. Fifteen minutes later, it was all over for him. But the forces opposing me in Washington are the same people who are responsible for every disastrous trade deal, foreign policy, blunder, and border security betrayal. Look at our border, our southern border is so great. By the way, we've topped 400 hundred miles of wall. Building 10 miles a week, it will be finished very soon, but it's had an incredible impact. Our border has never been as good, we got rid of catch and release, all the stuff that everybody said would be impossible, but it's been incredible, and Mexico is paying for the wall, you do know that, OK. They like to say, now finally, they say, OK, he's building the wall, but Mexico is not paying for it. No, no, Mexico is paying for it. They know that, but they don't like to say it. No, we're doing some incredible things. This is the most important election in the history of our country, and I used to -- Even to three months ago, I said, well, you know this is like very important, but 2016 was important, this is more important. This is war. And you know, success will bring us together, as I was saying. But you know what else is going to bring us together? A victory, because they're just going to finally say, let's just give up. We're going to say, these people can't be beaten, they're going to say, these people can't be beat, and many of them were so happy. Two weeks ago they heard Trump tested positive, they were so happy and then I got out like right away, here I am like a long time. I could've done -- That's true. Can you imagine he won't be able to hold any more rallies. He'll be recovering or worse, or worse. He'll be recovering or worse, and like 12 minutes later here we are, you know, like, oh forget, I was -- I've been doing this for a long time, or this is not my first rally right, but all these rallies are like this. The spirit of this country is unbelievable and that's what we have and even the fake news admits. We have more enthusiasm than any candidate in the history of this country. True. And he has less enthusiasm in my opinion than any candidate. I think he's the weakest candidate in the history of presidential politics, [Inaudible]. Now, with all of that being said, they have a corrupt media, they have big tech, they have all of this stuff, it's a very powerful party and they have advantages. You know, they automatically win New York. I don't know why New York is doing so badly. They automatically win California, I don't know why. California is doing so badly. The forest fires, no water, no this, no that, you know, minor little problems. They automatically win Illinois. I mean, we got to run the table. We got -- it's automatic because it's just the way it falls. You know, winning the Electoral College is a very, very hard thing to do and we just ran this string right, but it's a very hard thing to do, but we're winning in Florida, we're winning here. You know it's amazing, like if he came here, Sleepy Joe, if he came here, honestly, if they announce, it worked really hard to try and find people. No, I really mean this. We have tens of thousands -- look at this, this thing goes back, way, way back. I wish they wouldn't give these guys a good look. I wish they'd move them back a hundred yards. And I'm telling my people, I just -- I'll save a little time. My people, please, from now on, could you please move the fake news media back like another hundred yards? I hope you're listening too. No, because you know what, those cameras have magnifier zone, they can be back and you can get a lot of people. So, instead of standing behind the camera and looking at the cameraman's ass, we don't need that, just move them back and we get more people up here because it goes back forever. Thank you, back there. We love you, thank you, but we're going to move it back. Move them back. [Audience chants ""Move them back""] This can only happen in Georgia. You know, I have an idea, you just gave me an idea. We have a new T-shirt tomorrow morning: Move them back. Well, we did it with, you know, we did it with this Crazy Hunter, Hunter-Biden. Remember? Where's Hunter? I kept saying, where the hell is Hunter? Because he was gone. You know they caught him, stealing a lot of money, so he like disappeared, remember? And we -- I said, where's Hunter? And then I said, wait a minute, that's a great idea for a T-shirt. We came out with a T-shirt ""Where's Hunter"" became one of the big successes of the year. Where's Hunter. We were talking today about drug prices, and you know, in this country we have a very bad system and we have middlemen that are very rich and I was talking about how we're cutting out the middlemen. Oh, these are not people that like me very much and we're going with favorite nations and all that stuff we're getting it dug -- drug prices down 60, 70, 80%, but the middlemen, the middlemen are making all of this money, tremendous, the very wealthy. They don't even do anything, frankly, at least the drug companies that make the drug. So we're talking about -- we're talking about the middlemen and I say, wait a minute, I think I know one of the middlemen, it must be Hunter. Hunter Biden is a middleman. On top of everything else, China, Ukraine, Russia, plus he's a middleman, oh, what a family. Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange, and that's what he's done. It's a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination, which, by the way, should have gone to Bernie, you know. Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, if she would have left a day before Super Tuesday, Joe Biden would not have won any of those states, they split up the vote. It was super liberal, her, and it was crazy Bernie, and I say it all the time. I think Bernie Sanders is the nicest, greatest loser I've ever seen because -- no, it's true. And I mean, this -- and you know we're going to get a lot of their votes because they love us on trade. Because the one thing Bernie is right on is every country in this world, including our so-called allies -- Excuse me, are there any children in the house? OK, close your ears, children, screws us on trade, and Bernie's people know that, and Bernie's into -- The problem is Bernie wouldn't be able to do anything, but I've done a lot about it. I've done a lot about it. But you know, that's why we got a lot -- we got a big percentage of Bernie people and because they didn't like Hillary, but they don't like Joe and we're going to get a lot of Bernie people so I have to be nice to Bernie, but I consider him a really good loser because he loses with such -- he's so nice about it. He loses. I mean what she did to him was bad, but this was in a way worse because all Elizabeth Warren had to do is leave the campaign, didn't even have to endorse him and he would have gotten votes and he would have won every single state on Super Tuesday, and that didn't happen, and so now we have a guy with a little bit larger base, but no energy. Here we would have had somebody with a smaller base, but with tremendous energy, but not as much energy as we do and we have a big base, so I like that either. A long complex story, but what the hell, I have nothing but time, right? What the hell. In exchange for his party's nomination, he's handed control, and you know that, in exchange to the socialists and the Marxists and the far-left lunatics. If he wins, the radical left will be running this country, they're addicted to power, and God help our country if that happens, I really mean it. You'll never make a comeback. It'll be a large scale version of Venezuela. I've been saying that for a year, but I'd never meant it like I mean it now. The only difference is the size because the ideology is the same. Venezuela, 20 years ago, less, was so wealthy, one of the wealthiest countries, it had oil, it had everything, very, very magnificent. Now they don't have water, they don't have medicine, they don't have food, everyone's fleeing the country. You know, the only difference is the size, but the ideology, when you look at a Portland, I want them to let us in, I said, governor of Oregon, I said let us come in. I want to solve your problem, but they're radical-left Democrats, you know, it's just like the craziest thing, but that's what Venezuela is, they're anarchists. You look at some of their city, they're anarchists and they don't want to say and the press wants to call a peaceful protests and we originally had a hard time. We had a hard time. They didn't want us to have any rallies in certain states, and then I realized you're not allowed to go to church, you're not allowed to have dinner with people, you're not allowed to do anything unless in Michigan, you happen to be married to the governor because her husband -- You're not allowed to go sailing unless you're married to the governor of Michigan, in which case you can go sailing. Remember that? Did she get caught or what? Now she's blaming me because people were -- Whatever. I don't know what's going on, I don't know. I was in -- And it was our people that caught them, right. It's Trump's fault, always Trump's fault. Isn't it incredible? And yet we did her a favor. Who knows, I mean, they have to look at that whole thing too. But we are doing an incredible job in this country. This country's great and we have spirit like nobody's had spirit. And there's got to be a red wave. Next week it's going to be unbelievable. And they're talking about it. Look at that. It's millions of dollars worth of equipment and they'll never turn it around to show those people back there because they want to say, ""Donald Trump had a rally in Georgia, there was a smattering of people, a small smattering."" No, it's amazing. Nobody's ever had what we've had. And you're going to have a red wave. They call it a red wave. One of these characters standing right there, he said it could be a red wave. Don't say that could be, there will be. It's going to be a wave. And they don't want to go the phony unsolicited ballot. You know they send ballots out by the millions. They don't have no idea, well they do, actually, have an idea where they're going. That's what really -- but we say, who's sending them? Where are they going? Who's getting them? Who's delivering them? Who's signing them? What the hell are they doing? And then if you say that, they go, he's not for freedom, he's not for freedom, and they know better than you do it's a big con job, so we have to be very, very careful with the ballots because they find ballots in a garbage can last week, military ballots that had the name Trump on them and they're in a garbage can. They found 50,000 ballots from Ohio. They find them from North Carolina, dumped in a river. They find them, I think, 500,000 ballots in Virginia. They were incorrect, they're printing them wrong. They had one little problem on one set of ballots, thousands and thousands --thousands. They forgot to put the name of Donald Trump on the ballot, other than that the ballot was quite good. [Audience Boos] No, no, this is serious and I'm being serious about this. These people are doing a tremendous disservice and they're using COVID as the reason. You know, they're using -- they're using this as a reason not to go out and vote. So we voted in World War I, where, by the way, you had a pandemic that made this look like peanuts, OK. World War I. They voted in World War I. They voted in World War II. They voted during the Great Depression. They voted, voted, voted, but we can't do that, you got to send in a ballot. So complicated too, they have instructions, you do the ballot, then you do this, but some of them make it nice and simple. You don't have to sign, you don't have to verify, but what they don't tell you is we've won a lot of court cases. How about you put your ballot in and it has to be in by November 3rd, but you have two weeks in which [Inaudible] You have two weeks to count. Does that mean we have to hold up the whole election because, you know what, I want to find out who won or lost. I want to find out legitimately who won or lost on November 3rd. I'm not looking to find out -- I'm not looking to find out on November 19th or on December 1st or on two years from now, and if you take a look at some of these ballot schemes in New York, we had what a third rate politician named Carolyn Maloney, who I know very well. She used to come to my office all the time for campaign contributions, but she want to raise the number of ballots missing, that they have no idea her opponent, who could won, who was very close, but they declared her the winner. But her opponent has gone totally nuts, and you know what he should -- he should, but you look at that. You look at Paterson New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia. These are all races that took place recently, and they'll say, even I must say even in 18, they had a lot of disasters and even in 16, I didn't even know it, but they had a lot of ballots. I promise you, it will be against us. Ok, it will be against us. It will be against us, but you look at Nevada. We have a good chance to win Nevada but they're sending ballots to everybody. The governor was a backroom politician and I don't want him having the fate of an election. I don't think it's right that he has the fate of our most important election ever in his hands. I don't want that. So, if you see anything wrong, law, enforcement's watching marshals or U.S. marshals are watching same type of guys. These are no games. One thing I would say: law enforcement, they're on our side. I said it, I said it during the debate with Joe, I said Joe, name one law enforcement group that's supporting you, he couldn't do it. Then he was bailed out by Chris Wallace. Right? I said name, one law enforcement and I said Hey Joe just say the words law and order say those words, Joe. He didn't want to say it. I said Joe just say the words law and order. It's not hard Joe, law and order. He couldn't say it, he wouldn't say it. Then he tried, I think he said law and order and safety and security. You know because -- because he has to get the vote of the radical left and they don't like law and order -- and you know who likes Trump because of law and order in these suburban women who've gone over. I keep hearing because they want law and order, and I got a look at that, same thing happened four years ago. Same thing, they said women will not vote for Trump. Women will not, then the election's over. I said men and women really came out voted for Trump right? But, suburban women, I keep saying suburban women, and I got rid of a regulation that would have destroyed the value of your homes, okay, and would have made your homes very unsafe, with low-income housing being built all over the place right next to your house, I terminated it, and even my people they said, sir, you don't have to tell me, we can make it much quicker soon. No. no you don't understand. I want it terminated and I terminated it. Suburban women, please. Thank you very much. I heard they like my policy, but they don't like my personality, I said they don't care about my personality, they want to be safe and they want to keep their American dream. They don't care about my personality. They like my president, and I like them. I like them, I love them. The radical left is hell-bent on destroying everything that we love and cherish. You know it's that culture stuff, right? Cancel culture. They won't cancel culture, they want to get rid of our great heroes from the past. They want to get rid of our history, they want to get rid of our culture, right? I was at Mt. Rushmore. They want to blow a Mt. Rushmore up. I said to our great governor of South Dakota, Christie. I said, this has never happened in Christie. Don't worry about it, she said you don't have to. We don't even need your help or this one. It was so beautiful, Mt. Rushmore. They want to blow it up. I said not going to happen. None of that stuff is going to happen, but I will tell you a few months ago, if I weren't your president, you would have had the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, how about Lincoln? They want to attack even Lincoln, he's, probably looking down and he's saying, what the hell did I do I was on their side, I think, right? What did I do? They want to attack the Lincoln. If I was not your president, they would have attacked the Jefferson Memorial and I stopped it. I stopped a lot of things. I also saved your Second Amendment by law. They want to punish the middle class. Expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare. The Democrat Party has gone crazy, but they have contempt for America, they have contempt for the United States and I don't think Biden does. But Biden has no power, he's got he's gone and he's gone up here, he's gone. The Republican Party is proud of America. We're proud of America, we love America. We celebrate American values, American History, and American culture and we're working to deliver a truly extraordinary American future. But I want the Republican Party to get tougher because the Republican Party, they're very good people, but they're, not tough enough in terms of our values and what we stand for. They let these other people, these lunatics, get away with things like you can't spy on a campaign. You can't try and take over a duly elected president of the United States and get caught, and when you get caught, you have to suffer the consequences. It's very simple Joe Biden and the Democrats. Socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, and you see that going all over with Seattle at all. And by the way Seattle, so they knew we were going in the following day, so the night before they raised their hands and they left. Okay, very simple: I said, that's it, whether they like us in there or not, we're going in. They took over a big piece of the city and they weren't going to do anything. They knew we were going in and so the night before, they said, you know these little facts that I give you just to give you because that's the way it works is supposed to ask us. The governors are supposed to ask us, but these radical left, you know if you look at Republican-run states and cities they're doing phenomenally well, never done better. But if you look at these radical left, look at what happened to my beautiful New York. Since I left, three and a half years, it was doing great and I left. I'm not saying because, but maybe it is, but I left. I came to Washington -- what's happened to New York? What they've done to that incredible city and state is so sad. Look at Chicago look at what's going on there. Look at what's going on in Atlanta, look at Atlanta, it's so sad. What's going on? And these are radical left no bail, no cash bail! No, Nothing! I mean you kill somebody! No problem, no problem! They're going to have to get their act together, they're going to have to get their act together because we're not going to put up with it much longer. They want to dissolve your borders. Release criminal aliens raise your taxes. By the way, I'm cutting your taxes big. Biden. Joe Biden wants to substantially raise your taxes and that he says well, I'm only talking about people. I said No, no, no, he wants to terminate the tax cuts that we gave you so that's 2,000 and then you look at the energy cuts and you look at the child tax credit and you look it's a thousand dollars each and you look at all, It's seven, eight nine thousand dollars a family. Well, if you're going to terminate it, that means, it's $9,000\. I don't know about that. You know that he pulls out a piece of paper when he starts reading it out of his. Did you see that he did that? Yes, they pulled out a piece of paper because he couldn't remember any of the numbers he puts out and Georgia Stephanopoulos is sitting there watching this. He didn't treat me as nice. You know, so I did him two weeks ago and he was OK. It was fine. You know it is what it is right he's going to ask me a question right. You know the expression, he asked you a question, I give him an answer. That's all you can do right. You can't do any better than that, but they were nasty, pretty nasty and not terrible, but pretty last night was -- she was out of line. I mean, in my opinion, she was out of line. As I said, just relax, take it nice and easy. But when you watch the one the week before it's just so, it's such a difference. The beauty is, the people of our country, get it they're smart. They get it, they get it. They get it better than NBC owned by Comcast COM and I call it Comcast there used to be com. They spend a fortune on public relations and I come along and call them Comcast. It's a con job. They want to confiscate your guns, drive God from the public square and abolish the [inaudible] To defend our Constitution from this madness, I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. She's great. She's so smart. She's so smart, right? She's done a great job. She's done a great job and she went through it. No problem and they came at her. They came at her. It was like -- it was like your Atlanta team when they were good couple of years ago. How the hell did they lose that Super Bowl? Could you -- How the hell did that happen? I keep thinking man. If you own that team you worked for that team, I was like, that was a longshot, but you know it's one of those things, but, I was like that team playing at high school football team right? She was so much more talented than those people that were trying to embarrass her, and she was cool as the coolness was, do you have notes? Do you have notes? A blank? No, she doesn't need to write down notes, I don't have notes either, right. And most of this has been off this teleprompter because it was on the teleprompter. Many of you would say it is a little boring. Let's get out of here, Sam. Last night Biden refused to rule out court pack. In other words, they may take 16, 17, 18 people. He'll pack the court with radical left judges who will shred your Second Amendment, disarm law-abiding citizens, and protect terrorists and violent criminals. You know, I won the ban from jihadist countries or other countries. If people are bad, we don't want them in. So I went for the ban, everybody said, but I won. I won in the Supreme Court, and you know what, we don't want people that can't love our country. We don't want people that are going to hurt our country, so I have a ban. A very controversial and we wanted the United States Supreme Court and we don't let people in from certain countries that are going to look to do bad things to us. Pretty amazing what's happened, isn't it? Biden's agenda would also be a catastrophe for Georgia's seniors – seniors. To have many seniors in the house right but proud to be seniors right. For years, Biden tried to cut your Social Security. You know that and your Medicare. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and free health care for illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security because that's what's going to happen. You know, we all have a heart. I say this all the time. I mean, I have a heart. I don't want to hurt people, but once you say, come in, you're going to get free health care, you're going to get free education, the whole world is going to want to come into our country and we're not going to be able to even come close to affording it. I have to take care of our seniors. I can't take care of millions of people that had no intention of coming here before these maniacs made these pledges. He'll bankrupt these programs to finance the left. Open borders they want to take. Actually, you know, we're just finishing up the walls I said. They want to take the wall down some of them. We want to take down the wall. This wall is a dream, goes deep and it goes high. A lot of bad people are coming in because that they want to take it down many of them. While I'm president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch your Social Security. Under my leadership, we're delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. I love the recovery because here I am. Two weeks, I wasn't exactly feeling great, and you know when you're president, I told us today, when you're president, you get a lot of doctors. You get guys, Johns Hopkins, Walter Reed, you get all the great hospitals and you got these geniuses they're all over the place. Sir, let me do this. Let me do that. Let me do -- just leave me alone fellas. Get the hell out of here. But I wasn't feeling too great and they gave me something, Regeneron, and a day later, I felt like Superman. I said, hey, whatever the hell that stuff was. I brand new developed because of this and we're going to do something very special. We're going to get it for every person that we think is appropriate for, in other words, every person that needs it. But I tell you what, you know: they could call it therapeutic, but to me, it was a cure because the following day, our doctors are here. When you're a president, they followed, we got more doctors. If anyone gets sick, it's a great time when I'm around because You'll have about 15 doctors standing over you in about nine seconds. It's happened, it's happened many times. Somebody gets that's all well and all of a sudden they get the greatest doctors you've ever seen. They do a fantastic job, but, this was all developed just very recently months ago for this. It's incredible. The strides that we've made. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge normal life. That's all we want. I want a normal life like we had seven months ago. We don't want any. We want a normal life. In other words, next year will be one of the greatest years economically in the history of our country because that's where we're going. This election is a choice between a Trump recovery and a Biden depression. Let me tell you something, he's going to quadruple your taxes. He's going to raise taxes on businesses. All the businesses that have moved into our country are going to move out they're going back where they came. You're going to have a disaster, you will have a depression. The likes of which this country has never seen before if these crazy rules get in with the Green New Deal. You know, the Green New Deal, the real number is $100 trillion. You know, they say well, we could do it for like 9 trillion. Well, nine does it work either, but the real price is a hundred. They want to rip down buildings and build new buildings in their place with tiny little windows. No, if you don't mind, I'd like to keep my window I'd like to have a nice view of Georgia, no they want to. They want to. Think of it, they get $100 trillion. So, if we had an unbelievable economic surge that lasted 100 years without a problem, we wouldn't make a $100 trillion. This is the craziest thing done by AOC plus three, who knows nothing about the environment. She hasn't known. She's got a great line of bullshit. That's about it! Well, it's true. She does nothing about the environment. AOC plus three. These were not great academics. How about Ilhan Omar? You know I'm going to win Minnesota because, if you hand Omar, she hates our country, I mean you see the way she talks, she hates our country. No, please don't tell her to leave that happened once before. I got a lot of trouble. They start screaming, she should leave and they got me a job. They said, Why did you protest? But she doesn't like our country, you see what she says and I'm going to win. Remember this, Minnesota hasn't been one since 1970. That's a long time. 1972. And we're going to win Minnesota because of Ilhan Omar. Well, having Minneapolis ripped down and burned down, and then we come into the land and they should've called us in day one. Day one. The problem is, they keep waiting. They wait too. How about the CNN reporter? I think his name is [Inaudible] The shaved head. Nice shaved head, maybe I'll try that someday. I don't know. My poll numbers might go down or they might go up. You never know. Maybe they go up, but he's standing there, this is a friendly protest and behind him, the fire is like nine blocks long. It looks like Berlin during the worst days of their lives. The fires are raging. This is a friendly protest. Boy-oh-boy. Then they in the National Guard started moving forward and got hit in the knee with a canister of tear gas, and he went down. I've been hurt, I've been injured. These people are crazy. You know they don't report the violence in a report, the looting on CNN, MSD, and see all these different networks don't report them. They don't want to talk about them. They want to think everything's wonderful, it's not. And the reason it's not, a lot of it is because of them, but I will deliver optimism, opportunity, and hope, and that's what we're doing -- and this is why we have this kind of spirit and I hate to say it because I don't want to insult Georgia, but it's this way all over our country. We have the biggest rallies in the history of politics and nobody has rallies like this. Look that. Look at the people. Now look, I mean, you can't see this. This goes all the way back, so you can't even see how far back you can. I can't even see the end of it. We have the greatest enthusiasm, the biggest crowds in the history of politics, and they don't talk about it. They'll say, yes, there were a smattering, a smattering of people. That's true. He has the first lady. How did you like? It was good? Were there many people there? I said a lot. They didn't they show it? No, they don't show it. They just showed your face. They never go, she said, but I could hear it. You know, when you go to a Georgia football game when they're doing well, you can imitate, you can imitate thousands and thousands of people with hundreds of people. I mean, Biden had a rally today like 13 people showed up and they don't talk about it. They say, by this year, the one guy actually made a mistake. You call them sleepy Joe. Is it announced today that guy's job is gone, but Vice President Biden is here today. He's making a speech on the environment, but he has no idea what he's -- They don't say that there's nobody there. he's got the circles right there circles you ever see, he's got like five circles and he goes there and people standing and the reason that and the circles, not only are they big, although I love the artistry, because the guy really does a nice job, you know I'm into, but so it's very neat very round beautiful solid. I mean it would be impossible to catch anything if you're one of those circles because you're so far away. It's like, but I never joke about it. I mean, I don't think it's necessary for sleepy Joe to constantly, you know, he walks up to a stage. That people are, number one, there's no people there and the few people that are there are like what 50 yards away and the mask is always so large, you know it's like covers the whole face. I shouldn't joke. I shouldn't joke because you know what, running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics puts pressure on me. Could you imagine if I lose my whole life? What am I going to do? I'm going to say I lost to the worst candidate in the history of politics, I'm not going to feel so good. Maybe I'll have to leave the country. I don't know. Biden will deliver pessimism, poverty, and decline. Our nation will decline very seriously and again, he's been doing this for 47 years. They said, why did trump move faster? Well, when I put in the ban on China because they were heavily infected and then Europe shortly thereafter, Biden called me xenophobic. I said tell me what it means Joe. Please tell me what you know he was unable to define it. They wrote it down xenophobic, but he called me a racist, I think, because it was so early. Now time goes by and he said, he should have done it earlier. He should have done it earlier, but he was months behind me remember? He thought it was terrible that we close down to China and Fauci said, and he said very nicely said Trump saved thousands of lives by making that decision, and to be honest, I was like just about the only one that wanted to do it. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic and annihilate Georgia's economy and you're doing a great job, and you have a governor that's working hard and he's doing a great job. I don't even know if he's here, but he's working hard and he's doing a great job. We're going to find out and you've got a great first lady and we're working to safely reopen those schools. Reopen the schools, get those schools open all over our country. It's so bad, you know Barron right, Barron tested positive. My son. I said, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay like about two seconds later. how's he doing, Oh, he's okay now, sir. Because they have a great immune system, I guess. Who the hell knows. I mean they have an immune system. 99.9 something percent right: they're, young and they're strong. I mean for this particular disease, the flu they have problems with young children, real problems, real death problems, but for this, it's 99.99-something I mean it's like incredible, but no, Barron tested positive. The first lady is doing great. She's very good, doing a great job and she didn't do the regeneron thing. She did it the old fashioned way, she get better, but Barron, you know Barron, young kid, healthy kid, but he tested positive, and by the time I got to speak to the doctor the next time it was like, how's he doing doc? He is okay now, sir. It's gone. I said it's gone that quick, but this is what happens and then you're immune. It could be a long time, yeah, Barron's -- everyone loves Barron. Do you think he's tall enough? He's a tall young guy but he's doing good? But you know it's an amazing thing, the children. That's why they have to get back to school. We have to protect our seniors very much. We have to protect our seniors and that's what we're doing, but we have to protect our seniors. We have to protect certain groups, especially our seniors, with have a heart problem or they have a diabetes problem, but we got to get our businesses open. Now, in your case, your governor was very early. He did a great job, but you look at what's happened, you look at what's happened in New York, you look at what's happening in Michigan, we won the case. You know, the court ruled it was unconstitutional who's keeping everybody like in prison except her husband. She was keeping everybody. No, she was keeping everybody in prison. Pennsylvania. They got to open the state, we're going to do well in Pennsylvania too, by the way. North Carolina. We have Mark Meadows here by the way from North Carolina, great Chief of Staff. Where's Mark? A great chief of staff, he's working. He said, boy this is a very successful congressman and he's -- he's been doing a fantastic job. He's doing a great job. Is it an easy job Mark? No problem. But Biden will close your classrooms and you know what, he actually said the other day, he'll follow science, he'll fight. So that means, if Fauci says close it up, he's going to close up the country. It's not going to happen. And if you look at the numbers, the numbers are great and we're going to go over that. He wants to throw your children out of the school, close up your schools and shut down your workplace and we're now setting records for employment, unemployment. We're setting all sorts of records economically. Europe, which has imposed punishing, punishing horrible, really strong lockdowns, is now experiencing a massive surge in cases. You know the fake news would say, we'll look at Europe. I said we're doing better than Europe, but now Europe is exploding and they'll be okay, but they're exploding. Biden's plan will crush America. My plan will crush the virus and America will be stronger than ever before. So our early and aggressive action saved, I think at least two million lives. We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced the fatality rate. 85%, think of it that's over a six-month period and I'm working to make the antibody treatment and I've said it and I got it and, I said, listen for me, it was great and I'll bet for a lot of people. It's great. These are the great scientists they came up with some of the other incredible medicines of the last 10 years, this particular firm, but also Eli Lilly, it's very similar and we're going to make it available free to anybody that needs it. Free should be getting the final approvals very soon. No, I'm getting approvals from the FDA that people would have taken three years to get and those vaccines are coming out, but it's political even that I could have had them faster, but we had a little action. Nobody wanted me to get the approval before the election and you know what I'm not thinking about the election. I'm thinking about saving lives. The hell with the election. Thinking about saving lives. So I got a little -- a little political. Through operation warp speed, we will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year and maybe substantially before that. The vaccine will end the pandemic once and for all and they hate it when I say it, got the vaccine, it's really looking great. Numerous companies, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer are great, others too many companies, all of them, they're great. But you know what, without the vaccine, it's ending too. We're rounding the turn, it's ending without the vaccine. But the vaccine is going to make it go quicker. Let's get rid of it. We want to get it the hell out of here. So we're joined tonight by a man who I am so proud that I gave a very early endorsement to, and I did it because of David Perdue. David said, Donald. Mr. President, I have somebody's running for governor. I said governor of where? He said the Great State of Georgia. I said, tell me what's the story? He said, could you endorse him? I said, well, tell me about him. I did a little research and the only thing that mattered to me, I mean, to be honest with you, he's all Trump all the way. He was – before I knew him, I didn't know he had a very successful past, but I didn't know, but he was very, you know, he's like trump. He likes Trump and it's hard to endorse people that don't like you, you know. Somehow, I have a little problem with that, but his name, I say what's his name, Brian Kemp, and he's a really smart guy, a really good guy and I endorse him and he went on to win and his wonderful wife, Marty, is even better than him. But I have to tell you, we -- we campaigned together. We campaigned together and I mean I've never seen, we campaigned against, I guess Stacy, and we had Oprah. You know Oprah used to be a friend of mine before I went into politics. He'd be down in Mar-a-Lago a lot. She liked our key lime pie. He liked our key lime pie, but Oprah was great. She was a friend of mine, but you know, once you do this stuff, you lose a lot of friends very quickly, but that's okay. We're going to do the right thing. And we had Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, they practically lived in Georgia and all Brian had was Trump and Brian won fairly easily. It wasn't that close Brian Kemp great guy and Marty. Thank you very much. He's a great governor and he was ahead of -- he was ahead of the curve. He said we got to get this thing open here, and you know those are the states that are doing the best, the ones that are doing these lockdowns, not to mention the problems caused with depression, drugs, alcoholism, all of the other things. So I just want to thank Brian and Marty and it's great and you're doing good. How am I doing by the way Brian we're going to win it, because, if we're not I'll, tell you what I'm going to take my endorsement away from him if I don't. Now you're doing a great job as governor? Thank you very much, Brian Kemp. Thank you. Everybody. Another guy who's been a friend of mine for a long time. You know he's a very, very successful man and he did what I did. He wanted to do something, you want to give back. He loves this state like crazy, loves our country and he's central casting. If I'm casting a movie, and I want to pick a senator, you know what I do. I say I've got to get David Perdue to play the role, but he is respected by everybody in Washington. He is respected and revered and he brings back the bacon to this state. I want to tell you he came to see me, David, stand up. He came. He came to see me about the farmers when they got, that's how I got involved in the whole thing and the hurricanes and all the damage, and we brought in a lot of money for our farmers in Georgia right David? So, thank you very much great job. You're doing a fantastic job and come to think of it, I can't even believe, you know the guy that's running against him. I beat him once before. Two years ago he was running against a very good woman, Karen right, Karen Handel and she's doing very well, but he was running against her and we defeated him and then he said he's running against David, I said, this guy's not in the same league with David Perdue. I mean, that puts a lot of pressure on David. Just like I have pressure on me. You're running against these people. It puts more pressure on you David. It would be easier to run against somebody that was good, but he's a radical left. Schumer Pelosi guy. He's bad on the second amendment. I remember when he was running, he didn't even live in the district he's running for Congress. I said, what's going on? but we defeated him once and I hear you're going to defeat him again. Thank you, David. Thank you. So a person who's become a friend of mine and Brian thought she was fantastic and I met her and I said the only thing is you know, how would you handle pressure? You never know, there's a rough mean business and I found that she can handle pressure. She has been fantastic. She was with me, 100 percent on the impeachment hoax. She's been with us all the way and she's a great woman and her husband is a great man and a very successful man. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. By the way, some people would like to say, oh the husband's a great failure. It's much better. No, no, no. He's a really respected person and he loves his wife and she's, a terrific person, Kelly Loeffler. Kelly. Thank you. Great job, Great job, Kelly. Great job. I mean my only problem, she's running against another great guy, I just said run it out, I'm backing both of them, because Doug Collins is here. Where's Doug? Why am I in a lousy position? I like them both. I love them both. He's been unbelievable with the impeachment hoax and everything else. He's a warrior, She's a warrior, but you know what I like they're, both going to the polls they're going to bring their people with them, and you know the biggest winner is going to be Trump because everybody that votes for both of them is going to vote for me. But honestly, regardless of what happens, they're both going to be winners, because whoever does it efficiently win is going to have an unbelievable future. And I'm going to make sure of it because he's had two incredible people and I mean it, but what a lousy position to be in David right here like both of them. So we have somebody, Jody Hice, you know. Jody stand up. Joe want a job, a warrior. A warrior, thank you very much for everything, Jody. Jody's only leading his district by about 5,000 points, I wouldn't have to worry too much. We don't have to spend too much time, you're doing a great job, Jody. We appreciate it very much. Barry Loudermilk. Barry, thank you very much great job, great job, These are warriors. These are incredible. Rick Allen. Rick, thank you. And another one who wanted, you know, a guy who knows more about the farming industry. You know when I was picking the secretary of agriculture. They had all these political people come in, I said, do you know anything about farms? No, sir, I don't, but I'm a quick learner. I said. Oh, that's great, you know, I'm interviewing these people and I went through about nine of them and so far you know I didn't have any guy. I said, do you know what corn looks like do you know anything? Now, some of them had absolutely zero. I said, have you ever been to a farm, no sir, but I'm willing to learn? I said this is what I want, and then I meet this guy named Sonny Perdue. Somebody said right and Sonny came. I remember that meeting so much and Sonny came into my office and by the way, David called and Sonny called also about Brian, right? You know that Brian? Both of them, but he comes into my office and I'm telling you to this day, I learned more about farming in that 45-minute meeting than I learned ever in my life. I learned it all from you and you have done a great job and you've delivered 28 billion dollars, and I hear another 13 billion is coming to our farmers. He loves our farmers. He's been great. He's been an incredible Secretary of Agriculture, stand up again Sonny, come on. By the way, I guess he was also your governor for eight years right? I don't even count that. I don't care about that, but you know he was a very popular governor. Brian, you know that he was very popular. He did a great job, but he was a governor for eight years, but he has been a fantastic secretary of agriculture. Thank you, Sonny. Glad, I could say it in front of your home friends, okay? And State Representative Vernon Jones. How about Vernon? What a guy. Look at this. You know, I saw him on television a few months ago and he's talking about Trump is the greatest. He's the strongest. What he's done for our military, what he's done on the and I say he's a great guy. I wonder where he and I obviously I said, he's a Republican so and they put the thing on the bottom. It says Vernon Jones, Democrat, from wherever the hell he comes from. I said there must be a typo he's better than any Republican. I can't believe it and then I checked him out and he's a Democrat who likes Trump and we love him, Vernon. Thank you. He's a popular guy. Amazing. Spoke at our convention and somebody who's doing a fantastic job. Insurance Commissioner, John King John. Thank you. Great job, John. Appreciate it. Public Service Commissioners, Bubba McDonald and Tricia Pridemore. Thank you very much both. Thank you, Bob. Thank you. Thank you, Tricia. And somebody who better lead us to victory on, never speak to them again. We have a new state chairman of the Georgia GOP if we don't win, but we're going to win David Schaefer. David. Thank you. How we doing, David? How we good way up. I heard I saw Paul -- were way up. Don't just pretend we're even you know they do in politics. David Perdue told me this, pretend you're one point down okay and then, work your ass off and then just sit home and watch. That's what happened four years ago was that the greatest evening ever, but this is going to be better. This is got to be better. This is in its own way, even more, important. Candidates for Congress Andrew Clyde. Andrew. Thank you. That's great good luck. I heard you're doing really well. And somebody that I just think is fantastic. This one I never ever want to have her as my enemy, Marjorie Taylor Greene. She is so unbelievable. You are so unbelievable. Thank you and I looked at some poll numbers here, you're really up, but just pretend you're one point down please, okay? But you're doing great. They love you. Thank you very much. Congratulations, great job, And finally, Angela Stanton-King. Angela. Great! Going to be another great victory.That's gonna be a great victory. Thank you very much great job. Congratulations. And last but not least, we have a woman that won us the state of Michigan Ronna McDaniel. You know Ronna, was she was the chair of Michigan and she kept bringing me back and back and back, and I said who is this woman and then we won Michigan which hadn't and by the way, we're up in Michigan. It was just enough. We have a lot of car companies moving into Michigan and they've moved it. Thank you. Thank you. He's done a fantastic job now when it came time to pick the head of the Republican National Committee. I said, who is that woman in Michigan that kept getting me back there every week? I get a call, sir, you have to come back, you can win Michigan. I said Michigan hasn't been won in 38 years. She said, I'm telling you you're going to win. So I went back and back and each time I say, look, that's it. Ok, that's it! You know it's like a big deal. She said, no, that's okay, sir. That's it. The next day I get a call, you have to come back once more, and it was actually my last stop. It was at 1:00 o'clock in the morning now, actually, election day, we had 32,000 people show up at 1:00 in the morning in Grand Rapids, right? Grand Rapids Michigan, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan first time, you know, in decades, many decades and now we're doing well. A poll just came out we're up in Michigan. You know why? Because they had no car companies and no plants and no nothing for 44 years and they're building plants all over the state of Michigan because of me and they're coming in from Japan and they're coming in from Germany. They're building plants also and expanding plants, so I think Michigan likes us, we've done the job. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Done a great job and get out there and these three candidates for Senate, you've got to get out. There really get out there and vote there. Unbelievable people, they're unbelievable. Three unbelievable people and we appreciate it. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, which is true, there's never been anything like it, and now we are doing it again. You know, I see these hats make America great again. So you know what I say: Make America Great Again, again. Make America Great Again, again. We had it done and then the plague came in from China and not forgetting that you watch, we're tariffing the hell out of them. We're getting so much money. We gave it our farmers were targeted, we gave it to our farmers Sonny so that's fine. In my first three years, family income increased by $6,000\. Think of that $6,000 a family, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the Obama-Biden administration. Remember this, and I said it today and I never even thought of it, if they were good, I wouldn't be your president. I wouldn't have run if they were good. I wouldn't have even run, but they were horrible. So I won. If they were good and I did run, I would have won because they would have done a good job and I wouldn't have won, they were horrible. They had Ferguson, they had all of the problems in different places. Oakland. They had tremendous. Baltimore, they had tremendous. They had nothing but problems, it was a disaster, and anyway, and the trade deals with the worst and the Iran deal with $150 billion. We got nothing. And $1.8 billion in cash, African-American income grew nine times more. Nine times than it did under Biden and Obama. You know they called up David today they said, Sir, we have bad news. What's the bad news? Obama is going to start campaigning for sleepy Joe, I said, is that good or bad? Why is it bad because he campaigned harder for Hillary than she did? Get on? He was very ineffective as a campaigner to be. I thought he was very ineffective. So I think that's good news, but if you remember, you just remember this, he was a vice president for eight years to Obama and Obama refused to endorse him. He wouldn't endorse him, you know why? Because he knows he's mentally shot. He shot. And Obama, look, I mean he's a patriot and he says, I can't you can have a guy like this and then he ended up lucking out because Warren wouldn't get out of the race, and so they were splitting up the vote and what did he do? He wouldn't do it. It took him forever to make the endorsement David right. It took him forever and finally because he couldn't believe it, he couldn't believe this guy won, but they said he's going to be campaigning for him. Just remember what I said, he never thought it was possible that he won and then even after he won, he couldn't do it, but he finally got it done to bring opportunity security, fairness, and prosperity to black communities, I recently announced the platinum plan, which is a big deal. We will create three million new jobs for black Americans, increase access to capital, restore safety to every neighborhood, and we will deliver school choice, which is the most important thing. We're doing that. All done, and remember this, and I say this and some people think it's like a lot, but it's true. Don't challenge me, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump and it's true. I got criminal justice reform. That was me. That was not anybody else, but me they came to see me. I got criminal justice reform done. Prison reform, opportunity zones done with Tim Scott from South Carolina, great Senator great man. Great person was a great great person, and I got all of this stuff done. Opportunity zones and we did historically black colleges and universities every year. They would come up the heads of these colleges and universities, black colleges and universities, really good people, and after the third year, I said, how come you keep coming because they didn't have any deal so every year they had it come. I said, what do you feel like? He said, one man great guy. He said I feel like a beggar because every year would come up and beg for money. I got them 10 year, absolute funding. Historically black colleges, Obama wouldn't do it. Biden wouldn't do it. Nobody did it, I did it. Just remember criminal justice reform. That's the biggest thing. Biden has vowed to ban school choice and charter schools devastating the black community. We've spent the last four years, reversing the damage that Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years with his stupidity. He backed NAFTA. He backed TPP which would have been a disaster if I didn't stop it and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the worst things that's ever happened to our country. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations. Fighting foreign wars, countries that you've never even heard of, and defending foreign borders, but we didn't defend our own borders, but now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA, about time. They're all coming home. They're all coming home. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years, so necessary the Space Force and they helped us get it approved. And for our great veterans. We passed V.A. Choice and V.A. Accountability, and you heard two weeks ago, we've got a 91 percent approval rating from our vets. First time this ever happened. We took over 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria and when I took over, that was a mess. And we killed the leader of ISIS, who is trying to reform ISIS, Al-Baghdadi is dead. We took out the world's number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and troops all over the world, and many many people, Soleimani, is dead. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. They spent $150 billion to Iran that they used for terror. $1.8 billion in cash. I terminated, by the way, my first phone call. If we win we'll be from the head of Iran, saying, let's make a deal. Their economy is in tatters right now. They went down 27% GDP. I've never even heard of such a thing, but you know what, we don't want that. We want them to do fine, but they can never have a nuclear weapon. I recognize the true capital of Israel and open the American bank and open the American embassy in Jerusalem, and it's all built. It's all built. It's all built. We got it. Not only did we get it approved, I got the building built, I said, find the building on a site that we own and they came to me. You know that story they're going to spend $2 billion to build an embassy. As that sounds like a lot -- and I called our great ambassador, I said David, do we have any land in Jerusalem? He said, yeah we have a great site. I said take a look at it, call me. Calls me said, there's a building on the site. We can renovate it. We're going to spend anywhere from a billion to two billion dollars right, I said, Well, let's do this, Can we do something? Yes, he calls me back a week later and said, sir, we can renovate the building fully for $350 thousand dollars and we have already. Thank you. It's first time in my life and my business career I ever did this. I said David, it's too cheap. It doesn't sound good. Normally I'd say, let's make it 250\. I said David make it like 500 thousand and use Jerusalem stone. I have a friend Ron Barron, smart guy. He's so proud he's got Jerusalem stone in his lobby of his office building and I said, can you get Jerusalem stone? He said yeah, we're in Jerusalem. I said that's good. The whole place is Jerusalem stone and it was cheap as hell, I'll tell you. So we built this building for under $500 thousand and it's been open for a long time and every president for many many decades has said they were going to do it and not one of them got it done, and I got it done and got the building built. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they were working on, they were working on it for 52 years, I got in about two and a half hours and instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. You see what's going on? UAE, Bahrain, and we have countries lined up to sign. The fact is, I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years and now the Democrats are pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. People with pre-existing conditions are never going to get it. Their plan, and this green new deal will destroy our country. It's crazy. You know when I first heard it, I thought they were joking. Actually, I thought -- Oh, not even cows, do they want. They don't want cows. I think they gave up on that one, but they didn't really give up. They will never give up Biden's running mate, sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance, 180 million people that love their private plans right? They love their private plans. Those plans are going to be gone. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. 700 percent opening the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism. Your state in your country will be overrun and overwhelmed, will have no money and we will indeed be another Venezuela very large-scale version. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It's a vote for the American dream. It's the American dream and we're going to have it bigger and better than we ever had before. And in conclusion over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. it's already taken place. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amend -- we will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these absolutely ridiculous, endless foreign wars. Our troops are coming home, we will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. And I want to tell you, we have the greatest weapons, much of it built ever in the history of any country in the world. We are the envy of China and Russia and North Korea and everybody and when I came here, one of our most overrated generals in the world told me, one of the most overrated generals, he said, sir, we have no ammunition, and I said, no president should ever-ever hear that and now we have ammunition like you wouldn't believe, but we have rockets and we have missiles and we have tanks and we have F-35s and all sorts of aircraft, tankers and bombers -- and you only hope to God -- we never have to use it, that's all. But we are the envy of the world. We have rebuilt our military, $2.5 trillion and we have never had anything like it. So just hope we never have to use it. We will end surprise medical billing. Require price transparency and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs .they'll be coming down 80%, 90%, 70%. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, so important. America will land the first woman on the moon in the United States. We'll be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars and that's moving along rapidly, and we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto. In God. We Trust. In God. We Trust. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Georgia. I love Georgia. Early voting is underway so get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get your boss. If you have a boss, say, boss, you come with me right now and get out and vote early. Get out and vote. A giant red wave is coming from Atlanta to Augusta, from Savannah to Columbus, and from Marietta to right here in Macon, Georgia. Macon, Georgia, we inherit the legacy of Georgia Patriots who gave their blood sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who cross the oceans blazed the trails, settle the continent and tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the giant skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Georgia, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America Great Again. Thank you, Georgia. Thank you very much."
9,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Campaign Rally in Greenville, North Carolina ",October 15 2020,"Ah, thank you very much. Thank you let's see it's uh 1:30, this is a hell of a crowd for 1:30 in the afternoon. Thank you. Great state. It's fantastic to be back in North Carolina with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots. 19 days from now think of that. 19 days can you believe this? We're going to win this state of North Carolina. We're going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins, you see what's going on? And when we win, North Carolina wins, and America wins it's very simple. For the last 47 years Joe Biden's portrayed the workers of North Carolina through one act of economic treachery after another, and now you see what's happening; they got caught stealing folks. Biden's a servant of the wealthy donors and globalists and special interests who got rich bleeding America dry. Taking your jobs from North Carolina and every other place, and moving em out of the country and we turned it around, you gotta remember that. These corrupt forces, they don't see our nation as a protector of its citizens but as a vehicle for personal profit and power at your expense. And you see it happening right now. They hold everyone in contempt and they always put the American worker last. And that's what's happened until I came along. In fact it's the primary reason I came along if you think about it. They keep their jobs while outsourcing your jobs to other countries. Countries that you've never even heard about. They build walls for themselves while forcing your family to suffer the consequences of illegal immigration, drugs, and crime. And you know it very well over here. For five decades Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your boarders, and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. And you know they're all coming back, they're almost back. Our great soldiers. Our great soldiers. Countries you've never even heard about. He's the embodiment of the political class that enriched itself while draining the economic life and soul out of our country. Yesterday we learned from newly released emails, and I want to thank the New York Post for showing real bravery. That Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his sons corrupt business dealings. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he has been corrupt for many years, and everybody in Washington knew it. And just now a little while ago a new story shows up that Hunter made a deal with a wealthy Chinese business magnate for ten million dollars a year for introductions only. Introductions, I don't know. Will you take ten million a year to introduce people? Yeh to introduce dad. Dad say hello, and by the way dad give them everything they want. Okay give em everything they want dad. Hunter also referred to another more lasting and lucrative arrangement with the same Chinese businessmen that would be so much more interesting to me and my family that's what he said, that's a quote. These deals were made at the same time Joe Biden was letting China steal your jobs and take away your factories. If Biden is elected the United States will be owned by China. But we don't have to worry about it 'cause I can't believe. I can't believe it's gonna happen, he's shot. Just so we understand. We cannot have a leader that's just about half shot. Can you believe... Can we believe we're even fighting against this guy? But you know what they're a powerful party, they're a very corrupt party. They're in bed with the media, the fake news right back there. And totally protected by big tech. If I said what he said, they'd be calling for me outta there in 24 hours. What this guy has said. Two days...... ago he said, ""I'm running for the United States Senate."" That's the third time he said it. I'm running for the... And that's not, look, let's, that's not like a regular, like, mistake. You can make mistakes. He said that, and he said other things, but we won't even get into it. This is crazy. This is the craziest race. You know what, I'm running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. And if I lose, it puts more pressure... I wish he was good. I wish he was good, I'd have less pressure, you know, I mean how do you lose to a guy like that? How do you lose to a guy like this? Aye, aye, aye. And by the way, we're leading in North Carolina, [Inaudible], Carolina. Think we're leading everywhere where people are intelligent, actually. And you actually, we just got a report the lines are through the roof on areas that would more typically vote for us. Trying to be diplomatic when I say that. Thank you. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] But this election, is a matter of national security, it really is. We can't let this happen. It's a matter of national security. The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. Now big tech, you see what's going on with big tech? Is censoring these stories to try and get Biden out of this impossible jam. He's in a big jam. You know his sons left his, uh, laptop at some place. Fix my laptop, he forgot to pick it up. The guy from the laptop, it looks like he saw it, he said, ""Wow. This is really criminal stuff."" He brought it to the FBI, can you believe this? This could only happen to me. And the people of North Carolina, now this could only happen to... Can you imagine, he's fixing a laptop, he says, ""This is really bad stuff. I think I'll bring it into law enforcement."" Anyway, they've got it. They've got a lot of them. I hear they have stuff coming out you won't even believe. Yeah, you'll believe it. He and his family are crooked, and they were caught. They got caught. Now they're being protected by big tech. And if big tech persists in coordination with the mainstream media, we must immediately strip them of their section 230 protection. Okay, it's very simple. And we all believe in freedom of the press, but don't forget, big tech got something years ago that let them become big tech. They got total protection. They don't get sued, they don't get anything. They're totally protected. So the government gave that. So that takes away that little feeling that, ""Oh, gee, we can't talk to them about freedom of the press, et cetera."" No, we're going to take away their section 230 unless they shape up. And believe it or not, even the Democrats agree. Of course the only problem we have when they say that we're against, it's like the wall. You know, we're building the wall, it's going up. It took, it was so hard. It was so hard getting that done. There was very few people could have gotten that done. We are up over 400 miles. But here's what's happened. I just think back. All I had to say is, ""We will not build a wall."" They would have given me so much money. I had to say we were building it. But we got it going and we have the safest southern border we've ever had, so that's all good. In 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment and you elected an outsider as President of the United States who put America first. Now we've done a job, we've done a great job and, uh, it's been amazing. And our comeback, you know, we... Nobody's ever done anything like what we did and then we got hit by the China plague. Shouldn't have let it happen. And, uh, we're now coming back at a level that nobody's ever seen before. Nobody thought it was possible. They thought we'd be at 42% unemployment, we just hit 7.8%, can you believe it? Now we were at 3.5%. I even went to North Carolina, I needed a good chief of staff, I said, [Inaudible] where is he? Where's, where's Mark Meadows?"" Where's Mark? Where's Mark? Come here Mark, come here. Can you imagine I had to go to North Carolina to find my chief of staff. Uh, he's great, nah, he's done a great job. He's done a great job. And he followed me, and I said, ""You know what? I just tested positive."" He didn't care, he was in that helicopter. Hey, he's from North Carolina, what can I... He's great. Doing a great job. He elected me to restore the principle that's a nation's first duty, and it's to its own citizens. We're about our country, right? I'm president of our country. We're not president of the world. We're not president of the world. USA. So if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician. And if I don't always seem to be playing by the rules of the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you harder than any other president has ever fought for our country's people. And right now I'm fighting to eradicate the virus, and we're doing really a good job, we're rounding the turn, you see what's going on in Europe? It's flaming up. These characters back there that say, ""Well look at Europe."" Well I'll tell you what, go take a look. Go take a look. Now we're doing a great job, we're doing a great job, they didn't give the credit. I don't want the credit, but our vice president worked 24 hours a day, Mike Pence, and we had a lot of governors, they worked with us, but we had some that were really good, and some that were really not so good, I'll let you know, one day I'll write a little book, and I'll tell you who the good ones were. And we made a lot of people look good. We've done a great job, and we have some incredible statistics, but we wanna rebuild the economy, and that's happening quickly. We had the greatest economy we've ever had, think of it, now we closed it down, we saved 2 million lives by closing it down. We closed it down and now we're building it back up. And by the way North Carolina, tell your governor, open up your state, open up your school. They'll announce on November 4th that ladies and gentlemen, we're opening up, um, North Carolina and by the way Pennsylvania, you know, we've been suing a lot of states that are run by Democrats, right? High, I always call them high crime, but the fact is that's where the crime is, but, you know, we've been suing a lot of people and we just won in Michigan against... What she did was terrible, I mean, she did, she's like a prison warden, and, um, so Michigan we won on a constitutional basis. They have to open it up. You gotta open this one up. I mean, the people wanna get back, the kids wanna be back in school, 99,9%. Like you heard yesterday and as you know, my Barron, my tall Barron, he's very tall, my beautiful Barron , handsome, he is handsome, but my beautiful Barron had it, he recovered, like, so fast, they said, ""Wait a minute, how long did that take?"" They have the strongest immune systems, they're better than all of us, that's what they are, they're kids for some reason. But we've learned about this disease, you've gotta open up your businesses, open up your schools, get it going. We have incredible therapeutics, we have incredible drugs, we have, in my opinion, a cure because I took something, Regeneron, it was, you know, highly sophisticated stuff, the antibodies and the... Eli Lily makes an incredible drug, and what we've done is incredible, this has all been over the last six months, it's all happened. We got the FDA for fast approvals, they would've taken years and years, and they're doing it, they came to me on one, ""Sir, this will take approximately two years."" I said, ""Nope, I need it approved tomorrow."" They said, ""That's not good."" We got it. We got it. But this is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination. He has handed control of the socialists, I mean, he's given control of this party, the Democrats, they used to be like normal people, now they're socialists, Marxists, communists --  That's right, you said it, I didn't say it, communists, and some people would say, far left lunatics, look at the Green New Deal. Well, don't clap too hard, go out and vote, we'll clap later because these people are crazy. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country because they're addicted to power, and God help us if they win. We won't have our country anymore, and it'll never be able to come back, they never do, you know, if you look, 20 years ago, Venezuela had oil, had wealth, had, less than 20 years ago, had everything, now they don't have water. They don't have food, they don't have medicine, they have nothing but killing all over their streets. This happened in a short period of time, and it's the same ideology, you see it. The Democrat Party talks about decency and decorum while they demonize cancel --  you know the word cancel, right? They want to cancel your culture, and persecute anyone who refuses to bend to their will, I don't think they like me too much --  [Laughs] they don't like me too much. Thank you. That's really an honor. That's an honor, you know why? 'Cause those words --  nobody has ever heard them at a political event. I liked Ronald Reagan, and did say ""We like you, Ronald Reagan!"" But that's --  but nobody's ever heard those words, right? ""We love you."" Who ever --  what --  no, seriously, what politician has ever heard those words? I've never said those words. And that happens --  and I consider that a great honor, and thank you very much. But the Democrats smear decent Americans as racist, slander our nation as evil, indoctrinate our children and incite anti-American riots on our streets that we could control in 25 minutes as we did in Minneapolis, as we do wherever we go. But they have to invite us in --  by law, they have to invite us in. We want to go to Portland so bad, that one would take 15 minutes to set --  15 minutes. And the man that shot another innocent man, this was an innocent man shot, killed, instantly killed. I said, ""What happened?"" ""Well, we haven't arrested him."" Two days, three days went by. We sent in the U.S. Marshals, took 15 minutes, it was over. 15 minutes, it was over, we got him. They knew who he was, they didn't want to arrest him, and, 15 minutes, that ended. Anyway --  but --  and they call themselves ""peaceful protesters."" You know, in theory, we're not supposed to be --  and look at all the masks! You know, they keep saying ""Nobody wears masks, wear the masks."" Although then they come out with things today --  did you see CDC? That 85% of the people wearing the masks catch it, okay? Then you have my friend --  and he's a nice guy, Tony. Tony Fauci. He's a nice guy. And he said ""This is not a threat, this is not a problem, don't worry about this Don."" Then what's the problem? It's the craziest thing. That he said ""Do not wear a mask! Do not wear a mask under any circumstances, don't wear a mask. Don't, don't, don't,"" right? So, we don't wear them. Then they say ""Oh, wear a mask."" I never saw --  do you ever see any conflicts? But he's a nice guy, so I keep him around, right? We'll keep him around. He's a Democrat, everybody knows that, he's Cuomo's friend. Cuomo did the worst job of any governor in the United States. Almost 40,000 people died more and 11,000 at least. You know, I gave him this big convention center, 2,800 beds, he didn't use it. I gave him a ship --  I gave him the great hospital ship meant for wars. Hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of incredible --  you have to see this ship, I've been on it many times --  it's incredible. They didn't use it. Instead, they sent sick people back into nursing homes, right? It's a disgrace. The Democrat Party is ashamed of America, the Republican Party is proud of America, and that's a big difference --  big difference.  Thank you. So, you know, I'm being set up tonight, right? So I'm doing this town hall with, uh --  Concast. C-O-N --  right? Con, 'cause it's a con job. Concast, C-O-N not C-O-M. C-O-N-cast. So I'm doing it, and it's NBC, the worst, home of sleepy-eyes Chuck Todd and some others. And they gave Lester Holt --  he's a beauty --  they gave Joe Biden --  a week ago, a town hall, and it was meant for children. In fact, speaking to Barron Trump, fully recovered in like a record time. Barron Trump would do great on that show, 'cause he's a young child. They asked him questions that a child could answer, any child. A smart child, not such a smart child, and they got taken apart. You know, it was a joke --  it was a joke. And so they asked me if I'd do it, and I figured, ""What the Hell, we got a free hour on television. And we have Savannah Guthrie. She's always lovely, isn't she? But I figure why not? Watch the difference in tone between what they did to this guy that can't put two sentences together and what they do to me. But with me, it's me. It's our life. We know what we're doing and we just go on and we do it. But they're doing him on, they're doing him on ABC. And actually I'd like to watch him because I wanna see if he can make it through the program. And, and honestly, they'll be so soft. George Stephanopoulos, I did him a couple of weeks ago. It was fine. His questions were unfair. They said that the audience is neutral. Turned it out that they only had never Trumpers in there. But these are minor, you know, little, little minor facts. Well, that happened with the other guy, too. It was supposed to be neutral. It turned out that they were all like big Democrats, right? Big Democrats. Because you know what? The fake news media is corrupt, okay? It's corrupt. And we've shown it so many times. So I'll see you later on, NBC. I look forward to it. We're gonna be doing it from Miami where we're doing very well in Florida, too, by the way. We just got numbers back. We're doing very well. And the senior citizens are liking us, I think, [Laughs] more and more every day. Every day they see what we're doing, every single day. But we're gonna be doing that from Florida. So you watch tonight, you know? If you wanna have a little entertainment, watch. Let's just see. I just wanna see the tone of the way they treated this character and the way they treat us. It's not me, it's us. They way they treat us. So the candidate whose supporters are burning American flags, and I say all the time, ""Let's put in some kind of a major, major resolution. You burn an American flag, you spend one year in jail."" Do it. [Audience chants ""USA""] See, that's where the politicians are weak. [Inaudible] the politicians could do this. That's where they're weak, the politicians. And you know, I think it lost five to four in the Supreme Court. Now we have a different Supreme Court. Hey, by the way. Can you imagine? We're going to have number three in one term, which is a record. A record. You know, presidents go an entire, you know, presidency, a one term, two terms without ever having to pick a Supreme Court. I have three in the first term. Their heads are exploding. [Laughs] These people can't believe it. You know what? Our friends over here, they can't believe what's happening, I'll tell you. But we have three, and how good is Amy? How good is Amy? All right? [Laughs] It's happening. They said, uh, he should not be able to do this? I said, ""Why? I'm in my fourth year."" He should not be allowed to do it. But then they have a quote from Justice Ginburg, Ginsburg talking about, I guess it was, uh, Obama, right? That, well wait a minute. He's elected for four years. He's not elected for three years. That didn't help them, you know? That didn't help their cause. No, we got it done. It looks like, uh, it's gonna be done very soon. They have a one week period where they sit, but they're getting out of committee and it's very exciting. And I'll tell you what. She's been flawless. She hasn't made a mistake. She's toying with those Democrat evil people. They're evil. The way they treated Justice Kavanaugh was one of the greatest disgraces. I've never seen anything like it, and I've watched a lot of unfair things. I get treated that way all the time, okay? But I wanna tell you, I've never seen anything like it the way they went after Justice Kavanaugh with false accusations and everything else. It's a disgrace. But they're not playing that card here. They're not playing that card. At least so far they're not. But we'll be watching very closely. But she's been spectacular. She's getting rave reviews. She's a great intellect. Her professor who was a great professor many years said the single greatest student that he's ever had, that meant something to him. You know, it's always nice. As long as you're doing it, you might as well put smart people. Now, they'll say he discriminates. He discriminates against others. No, I like to have smart people on the Supreme Court. And she's been great. But the candidate whose supporters are tearing down our statues is not going to deliver any civility. And by the way, we solve every problem. And these are Democrat radical left usually, but Democrat areas that are having these high crimes. The Republicans are doing fantastically well. Remember no cash bail? They do things that nobody could even conceive of. And they're out of control. But you know what's gonna bring it all together? Success. Because we were bringing it all together. Before the plague came in from China, it should have never happened. They shouldn't have let it happen. They let it happen. We're not forgetting. They'll pay for it. But before the plague came in from China, well, Biden's not gonna make them pay, no. He's gonna get cash. They pay his son a lot of money. What's he gonna do? Say, ""Hey. You know, you shouldn't do this."" And that's true. That's like common sense. Look at the money they've taken out of China. I'll tell you what. He really is. He's a corrupt politician. Just remember it. And I'm gonna say it more and more, and, and Facebook and all can try and shut us down, but you know what? Everybody knows it. You don't have a kid who gets thrown out of the military, hasn't got a job for a long time. His father becomes the Vice President, and now this kid's going into every country walking away with millions of dollars from every country with no talent, no skill, no expertise and the press doesn't wanna cover it because they're corrupt. Is that true? I mean, it, it... How, how true is that? And then you look at the way Joe Biden lives. He lives on a politician's salary for his whole life, 47 years, right? And he lives in these beautiful houses all over the place. I haven't seen them. I haven't seen them. But he's a politician and you're not supposed to live like, uh, you've made $20 million a year. So he's corrupt as hell, and everyone knows it. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your job, and that's what they've done. They've killed your jobs, dismantle your police departments and that's what they're doing, dissolve your borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes by four times. And how about this? How about the fracking? There will be no fracking. You know, that's what everybody was against 'cause, you know, the super radical left primaries, right? There will be no fracking. Here's Biden, ""No, I said. There will be... How many times do I have to say it? There will be no fracking."" Now he gets the nomination. The following day he said, ""No. There will be fracking."" And I said, ""Okay, he's gonna get killed by the media on this."" They never even asked him the question. I hope you're watching Pennsylvania because you will lose one million fracking jobs almost immediately, because you know what? Joe has no control over their party. That's all AOC and crazy Bernie and all these maniacs. But we were coming together really well. There was gonna be... I was getting calls from people that normally I wouldn't want, and they wouldn't want me. And they're saying, you know, it's amazing. We had the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. We had 160 million people working. Think about it. 160 million. We were never even close. We were beating China at a level that they've been beaten before. I was charging them tariffs. They didn't know what the hell to do. And, you know, they were always gonna overtake us in 2019. If you go back 15, 20 years, 10 years, China was always gonna overtake us, 2019. Well in 2019, we became much, much bigger and we were way overtaking them, and they weren't even close to overtaking us. It was just the opposite. But we were coming together as a country because everything was good. Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, people with diplomas, people without diplomas, people with no high school education, PhDs from MIT. Everybody was coming together, and then we had the plague. But that's gonna bring us together again, because you had your best year in the history of your state. You had the best year last year in the history of your state. You're gonna have a better year coming up. There's gonna be a better year. And watch your third num- watch your third quarter. Watch your third quarter. But the radical Democrats will confiscate your guns, destroy your suburbs. I keep hearing about the suburban women. Yeah. [Laughs] The American dream, it is. I- I let you have the American dream. I wiped out a regulation that will, will destroy the suburbs, you know that? You know about that. I wiped it out, right? They don't wanna have a project built next to their beautiful house, right? So why is it that the fake news keeps saying that women aren't gonna like Trump. I think... You know what women want more than anything else? They want safety, security and they wanna be able to have their houses and leave me alone, right? The suburban woman. And then early on, before I realized it wasn't politically correct... Sorry, folks. Haven't been doing this too long. I said the suburban housewife loves Trump, and they went... By the way, the women, th- they loved it. Does anybody mind that term? Is that a bad term? [Audience responds ""No""] You know, the only people that mind it are those people there with the cameras, look at them. Look how innocent they look, and they're not innocent. They're not innocent. The enemy of the people. I call them, ""The enemy of the people."" But anyway, so the suburban women should love Trump. Now this is the same thing... This is like a carbon copy of what happened last... And not nearly as bad. Remember you had nine states, I was going to lose all of them the day before, and they were just wrong a little bit. I won all of them. So... I was going to lose all nine. They said, ""This will be a horrible evening for Donald Trump."" That wasn't President Trump, that was Donald Trump. ""This evening will be over very shortly."" Then we win Florida. We win North Carolina, by the way. We win South Carolina, we win Georgia. We ran the coast. We just ran it one after another. And, remember it said... They had this little crazy chart on, uh, NBC. And that's when the people started crying that worked there. My God, what am I going to tell my wife after two and a half years of saying, ""He's not going to make it""? And remember it said 3%. I had a 3% chance, right? So it starts at 3%. Then we won Utah. Remember we were supposed to lose Utah? We won... We only won by 22 points, you know. Very accurate. But, so we win Utah. So we go 3%, 5%, 8%, 12%, 21%. Now they're saying, ""Man, that sucker's... That number's getting bad up there."" That little number. Then it started getting smaller. You know, because their, they did, they made the numbers small. But the number was actually getting bigger. 21%, 25%. Then we won a place called North Carolina. It went from 25 to 32%. Right? Do you remember that evening? Wasn't that a great evening? Started off with Ohio, remember? You can not win unless you win the great State of Ohio. I heard that for a year. And then we won Ohio by eight point. Everyone said, ""Nobody wins it by eight."" By the way, we're doing better there now than we did four years ago. And, the great Jim Jordan and all those guys. So, we won by eight points, and that was the beginning. They said, ""Wait a minute, not only did he win, he won by a lot."" But that was like the, uh, their little signal as to what was happening. So then it goes to like 25, then 31, 35. Now we hit the 42. So now we have a 42 chance of winning. And I'm looking at all these others states, and I'm leading in most of them, right? We won 32 or 34 states. So it goes 34, 38. And now they're going, ""Oh, what's going on here?"" And remember the guy, right? John King at CNN. And he's good with the board. I like, you know, he's got nice action. But, you know, it wasn't so good that night he was shaking. And he's going, ""Well, okay, well, look, this is not looking good, uh, this is not good."" I don't know. And now he's a nervous mess, right? And he's going, ""What's going to happen?"" What's going to happen? Who's there, Heather? [Audience member calls out ""Hammer. Bill Hammer""] Oh, Hammer. Bill Hammer. Well, Bill Hammer's a good guy, right? Bill Hammer's a good guy. Oh, he said Hammer's better. I agree with that [Inaudible]. Hammer's a good guy. But you know what? It's very interesting. So then we go from 42 to 48, 54, 60, 64, then 71. Then 78. Then you see all the people screaming, and crying, and the most beautiful, most beautiful convention center. They had that... Remember they had the earth that was shaped like the United States. And they had the podium on the state of Florida out there, hanging out over... And I looked. I said, ""you know,"" I said to our great First Lady, I said, ""First Lady, that is the most beautiful looking thing I've ever seen."" And the way they had it, they spent a fortune. But they knew something was wrong, because they went to Gucci, right? And they were in the river at the convention center. And they had a big display of, uh, fourth of July, the... Whatever the hell it is, right? The fireworks. And they paid a lot of money. But now they had to pay $7 million. They owed $7 million to Gucci, and they, uh, were all set to do it. And then they decided to cancel. So, I then called up Gucci. I said, ""Listen, it's way far away from my location, but I'll give you a million dollars, okay? I tried to buy their fireworks. I figured I'd give New York it. Have a little fun. But I'll never forget that beautiful... And it looks so beautiful, 5:00, it's beautiful, they're all looking like ""Oh, they're gonna have a big evening."" And by 8:00 in the evening you watch these people. Remember the woman that, woman who was screaming? You know the one I'm talking about. Screaming. How about her? You think she's a reasonable person to deal with? And she was screaming there. Screaming. And it was a... And they talked about the glass ceiling. Right? The woman breaking the glass ceiling and it didn't work out that way. The glass ceiling broke her but there will be a woman that breaks the glass ceiling. It just won't be Hillary. And you know who else it won't- you know who else it won't be? [Audience member calls out ""Kamala""] It won't be Kamala. Won't be. It won't be Kamala but we worry about her. I'm very concerned about her because as you probably just heard, just before I walked out, two of the people that travel with her, her chief of staff and somebody else, in the plane with her all the time, uh, they have been tested positive for COVID-19. So we, we extend our best wishes. Right? Right? Yes? We extend our best wishes. We extend our best- which is more than they did to me but that's okay. That's okay. So, uh, let's see what- what happens. I mean, it's a tricky thing, it's, uh, it's dust. It's a little tricky thing. Masks, no masks, everything, you can do all you want but you know, you still need help -- [Audience member calls out ""Amen""] From the boss. You need help from the boss. It's what happens. We need help. Yeah. We need help. It's all right to say. Now, they'll criticize me for that. ""How dare he say that? How dare he say that?"" No, I'll say it. I'll say it. I'll say it. Somebody said to me the other day, ""You're the most famous person in the world by far."" I said, ""No I'm not. No I'm not."" They said, ""Yes, you are."" I said, ""Nope."" They said, ""Who's more famous?"" I said, ""Jesus Christ."" I'm not taking any chances. I'm not gonna have an arg- hey, I'm not having any arguments. Jesus Christ. I'm not gonna take any changes. [Inaudible] I guarantee. And let me look up and I'll say, ""And it's not even close."" [Laughs] To defend our Constitution, I proudly nominated Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. It's been so popular. A lot of people said I got elected because of the United States Supreme Court. I don't know that it's true but when I ran, you know, I- people knew who I was and all but they didn't know too much about my politics and they're thinking maybe I'm liberal, maybe I'm, who knows? They didn't know. And they weren't happy because they didn't know who I was gonna appoint as a Supreme Court Justice. You know, was I gonna put a radical left person like he will put? He's gotta give a list, by the way. Not only does he, can he not pack the court which would be horrible. Horrible for a country, for that institution but he's gotta get a- give a list of ten, 12, 15, 20, 25 that he will only pick from because people have to be able to see who is going to pick. You can't let somebody go up and put a crazy, radical, left Justice in the Supreme Court. So I'm going a step further than them. They don't press him much. How about a guy, how about if I said what he said? He said, ""No, no, I'm not gonna [Inaudible], I'll them after the election."" Oh, that's great. That's wonderful. And then these guys walked away. No, no. He's gotta say about packing the court but he's also gotta say who- from what group will he pick. Give the names because you have to know that. You have to know that. And you know, they say that's what won me the election. I don't know if it's true but a lot of people say, because I, I came up... And I was having a lot of, when I first went, I had a lot of bite back where people were saying, ""Well, wait a minute. Who's he gonna pick as a Supreme Court Just-?"" And I said to my people, who were some really great people, I said, ""Give me the top 25..."" there was 20 and then ultimately expanded to 25 judges, lawyers, you know, group of people, ""give me the top 25 judges, et cetera in the United States. I want the smartest, the best, the most brilliant and I'm gonna put them in a list."" And I didn't know, I don't think, almost any of them but these are the most respected people. They believe in a thing called The Constitution. Okay? Which Biden's people won't believe in. You'll see some real beauties if they put in the truth, right? That's why they don't want to do that because you couldn't win an election if you had to do that. So I said, ""Give me the top 25."" And then I went out and I played a little bit cute, I said, ""All right, I will pick somebody like these people."" And you know what, that didn't play. They said, ""No, you have to pick one of these people, two of these people."" And that's what I did, I said, ""All right, I'll do that."" And they say that was 20 or 25 points in terms of the percentages of what I got was a big thing on the United States Supreme Court. Well, I've done it again. I've now taken my original list and we had two great people put, as you know, Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch. And by the way, nobody's ever suffered like Justice Kavanaugh, what he went through, nobody. But we put Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, Gorsuch, she's just fantastic, intellect, fantastic people. And now we have Amy to go along with it and it's gonna be unbelievable. In other way they'll be voting, the full senate will be voting. And I don't know what could stop it 'cause it's uh, she's so good. It's a, it's freight train, okay. But the fact is, so we'll have three, but you know what, Joe Biden has to tell you who. If he has, because the next, the next president, whoever it maybe, it'd better be us. Because if it's not, if it's not, honestly, you will not have the same country, because the next president, the next term will have anywhere from one, two, three and even four picks. A very unusual. I was very unusual at three, it's a record. But you know what, for a term. But you know what, the next could have just by statistically, one, two, three or four. So your whole court is as good as we're doing now, and if I didn't do this you wouldn't even have a second amendment. You wouldn't have a second amendment. But if they put on two, three, or four, that means they will over ride and that's good for 30, 40, 50 years. And you know, the judges, they go in young and they last for a long time, which is nice. So Biden has to go out, and he has to not only talk about not packing the court because anybody who wants to pack the court shouldn't, shouldn't win. And Justice Ginsburg said that. She said, ""No, the nine, we're friendly, we get together. We're not, we're for the country."" She said uh, she made the greatest case for nine. Once you get a big group of people, then you're into the Senate, you're into the House, you know, we've already got that, right? And this is a great institution, maybe our greatest institution. Now we can't let some radical group of people destroy it. So number one, he can't pack the court. And number two, he's got to explain one of 25, or 30, or 40, or 50 people, but he's got to put up a list of people from which you'll chose. And the voters have to know who those people are and he can't get away with ""I'll tell you after the election,"" and then destroy our country. He can't do it. So that's it. That's it. That's much more interesting. They're going off the teleprompter, what do you think of that? But, uh, but you got to say it. You got to say it like it is. So Biden's agenda would be a catastrophe for North Carolina seniors and you know that better than anybody. For years Biden try to cut social security and Medicare. People don't know that about him. But he try to cut the social security. You know, great genius, he's gonna cut your social security and your Medicare. Now Biden's pledging mass amnesty and free healthcare for illegal aliens and you saw that, you saw that three months ago when he's on stage and he's said to all of these very radical left candidates, who wants to give illegal aliens free healthcare. And they all raised their hand and Biden didn't. And then you can see his right shoulder, it went. [Inaudible], I'd say he's the [Inaudible]. And his shoulder was, he looked around, he didn't know what the hell was happening. But he knew everyone else's head was up. Remember that though? He was like, he knew it was wrong, look, he's been there for 47 years, hasn't done a damn thing. He's been there forty- he knew it was wrong but his right shoulder started moving. And I said, ""I just won the election."" I said, ""Isn't that nice?"" And you know what, we all have a heart, but what that does is it brings millions of people into our country. They all want to get healthcare, they want to get education, they want to get all the things, and they want to give them, and you can't do it. You can't afford it. But that's what they want so we're not gonna let that happen because it'll decimate Medicare and destroy your social security and everything else. While I'm President, no one will touch your Medicare or your social security. And under my leadership we're developing, the vaccines and therapies and all of those things. And you vote for me, prosperity is happening, already it's happening, it's happening so fast. Nobody can believe it. We're the number one country in the world by far for economic comeback. And we went down less than any other county, think of that. Normal life, that's what we want, we want normal, I don't want to talk ab- we want normal, we want to get back to where we were, nine months ago, eight months ago. We want to have those football stadiums, those great teams of yours, we want to have people sitting next to each other, screaming like crazy. You look at the stands, we have a person and then 20 empty seats, nah, that's not it. And we'll be back, we're gonna be back very soon. Next year, will be, maybe, the greatest economic year, one of the greatest economic years, but maybe the greatest economic year. I think better than last year. Last year was your best, I think we're gonna do better. And to a large extent this election's about many things, but it's between a Trump recovery and a Biden depression. Because if they get in, they're gonna raise your taxes quadruple. He says it. They're gonna allow millions of illegal aliens in. And they're gonna let regulations, all of the cutting that I've done on regulation, which is a number that no president has ever even come close to. Whether they were four, eight, or in one case, more than that. They're gonna let all those regulations come back in. And the farmers know what I'm talking about. And the tobacco growers know what I'm talking about. Cause you couldn't even farm your land, you had so many regulations. Joe Biden would terminate a recovery. Delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate North Carolina's economy with [Inaudible]. Unscientific lockdowns. He'll keep you locked down, except at a level that you've never seen before. You won't have a state, by the time this guy finishes up. Biden's plan will crush America. My plan is already crushing the virus, look at our numbers, look at our number. This week, oh dammit, he must have lost his job, he must have been a nice guy, I'm sure he lost his job. This week, even the failing New York Times, the poor writer. I, I read this and I said this guy is gone. But, I didn't know him, so what the heck? The New York Times said that we had so good, this is the quote, experts are saying, quote, ""With genuine confidence, that the pandemic in the United States will be over far sooner than anybody ever expected."" How about that? New York Time. That's right, the writer of that article is gone now, but may he rest in peace. They don't want to say that, they're not happy to hear that cause they don't really have our interest at heart. Our early and aggressive actions saved so many lives, millions of lives. We pioneered all of these incredible therapies and reduced the fatality rate 80, think of it, 85 percent. We understand the disease and we have things that work. And I'm working to make the antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that wants it, that has a problem, free. And it's free, because it wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault and I only hope it works as well on you, but I'll tell you I felt like Superman a day later. Here I am! Here I am! I actually looked at the doctor, he's here with us now. Great doctors, we had so many doctors, I never saw so many doctors. All geniuses. Lowest IQ, 187. Now they weren't thrilled. When I looked at them I said, ""I don't know what the hell you gave me, but I want some more of it."" That was a transfusion and it was, like, amazing. So we're gonna make that available to everybody, we're trying to get it immediately approved by the FDA. And Dr. Hahn is working the [Inaudible]. And hopefully you don't need it. And for the most part you won't need it. I think for the most part, but you need it, we're gonna get it to you and you're gonna get it and you're gonna get better. And I call it a cure. They call it a therapeutic, I call it a cure. Regenera. And they have others that are very similar, great companies. I told ya before, Eli Lilly, et cetera. Through operation warp speed we will have a 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year. The vaccine will end the pandemic. But, it's ending anyway. I mean they go crazy when I say it. It's going to peter out and it's going to end, but we're going to help the end and we're gonna make it a lot faster with the vaccine and with the therapeutics and frankly with the cures. So we're joined today by some incredible warriors and... Friends of ours, Congressman David Rouzer. Where is he? David. David Rouzer. There's a warrior. How we doing David? We doing okay in this state? You're doing good. Do you have any competition in the race? Any competition? Or not much? I love that. I like when they say, ""Not much, sir."" But if they have, I- I'm always there to help, right? I'm there to help. Thank you, David. Great job. We have a candidate for North Carolina, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Catherine Truitt. Catherine. Great. Great. Thank you. Good job, Catherine. I heard that. Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, who just recovered herself, by the way. For anybody that's sitting, look. They're all jumping. Oh, she just recovered. Let's get the hell out of here. No, Ronna's great. Where is Ronna? Right here? Thank you, Ronna. She's great. She did a great job. She ran Michigan for us four years ago. She did so well. And many, many decades since a Republican won Michigan. We won Michigan. They said, ""I want that person,"" the RNC, ""I want that person running the RNC."" She's great. So Ronna, thank you very much. She just, she just fully recovered from COVID. A lot of people are recovering. You know, people are recovering. 99%, 99 plus, plus. And now with what you can do. You know, one thing I do say, get there early. Get to the hospital early. Get there early. They can do things, lots of things. But don't get there late. Get there early. And North Carolina, GOP Chairman, a friend of ours, a great gentleman, Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. Great job. How we doing? Doing all right? Looking like a good win, right? And are the numbers that big standing in line getting ready to vote, right? Bigger than you anticipated? No, he's saying the right things. Thank you, Mike. No, I hear it's, uh, it was on the... It was broadcast today. The numbers are crazy. You know what it's called? And this is what we're gonna have. We're gonna have a red wave. It's a [Inaudible]. They don't wanna send in the ballots and have the ballots thrown away into a dumpster. Who you for? Trump. Get rid of that one. Get rid... This is the craziest thing. They wanna vote. Our people wanna go and they wanna vote. It's gonna be a big beautiful red wave. And let them put in there [Inaudible] and we'll check in every one of them. We're watching very closely where they came from, where they went, how did they get there, right? All this stuff that's going on. Not a day goes by when you don't read about what crooked things are happening. But the red wave will crush it. And those are people that gonna get there on November 3rd and previous to that, you know, the open voting, when you can vote. But they're gonna get there and people are talking about it already. And you're seeing that, aren't you, huh? You're seeing that. That's great, Michael. That's great. [Inaudible] have a lot of fun. [Audience member says ""A landslide""] Because there was... [Laughs] A landslide, well we're gonna see. We're gonna see. But, uh, we gotta good shot. No, we're doing great in Pennsylvania. We're doing great in Michigan. Doing great in Arizona. I heard some very good numbers just now in Nevada. Um, we're doing good. I mean, we're doing good all over the place. And I don't wanna say it too loud because, you know, they got all this money. They'll spend money like crazy. But you know, ultimately money doesn't get you there, 'cause I spent 25% of what crooked Hilary spent, right? I spent 25%. And even after I won they said, ""He didn't do as good a job at fundraising."" I said, ""I spent less money."" Like I criticized that we won. You know, my father taught me a long time ago, if you can win for less money that's a good thing, not a bad thing. A good thing, right Michael? Under my administration we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we are doing it again. In my first three years family income increased by $6000, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of that. So we did more than, really more than eight times. African American income grew nine times more than it did under Biden and Obama. Nine times. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, Asian American unemployment all reached in history record highs, highest in history. And we're getting them all back. They're all coming back. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty. Since the China virus, we've created a record 11.4 million American jobs. We have never produced jobs at that level and that speed. We've already cut the unemployment rate in half and think of it 7.8, 7.9. That sounds terrible but, you know, it sounds pretty good when they're telling you about the 42%, right? Cause I think of 42, you know, what are you gonna do? We have this crazy situation that happened and uh 7.8%, it's uh pretty incredible when you think about it, and we'll get that way down, and it's going down fast, under Bi-, well, meh, just watch this. Under Biden it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost in their crisis. It wasn't a crisis, though. It was not great times, but it wasn't a crisis. We did it in five months, so they had 30 months and they had the weakest recovery in the history of our country dating back, actually, to when they started. 1929. It was the weakest recovery in the history of our country. And then he wants to tell us how to do things. For 47 years he did nothing. I love these guys, you know, for 47 years he did nothing. Now all of a sudden he wants to do all of these things that I did already. I could do better. You shouldn't have let China in. Well, for two months he was saying I- I was xenophobic because I closed the borders very early. Didn't I, huh? Jobs have been recovering. 23 times faster than the Obama/Biden recovery. 23 times. Not 23%, 23 times. And these numbers come from the great Larry Kudlow, who's a good man by the way. We've spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over us for 47 years. Think of it. Biden has waged a decades-long assault on your state, against your state's tobacco growers. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, which was a disaster. TPP, which would have been a disaster, had I not terminated it. Would have destroyed your state. It would have destroyed manufacturing in our country. And he was totally in favor of China's entry into the World Trade Organization. That's when they took off like a rocket, but not so good anymore. For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of North Carolina workers. He should not be asking for your votes. He should be begging for your forgiveness. That's what he should be doing. What a job he did. I mean, you go back four or five years, you people were hurting. You were hurting. I have plenty of friends in this state, you were hurting. For decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. Countries you never heard of. But, now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA. [Audience chants ""USA""] That's probably the main reason I ran in the first place. And I made this statement the other day. It sort of made sense to me. If Obama and Biden did a good job, I would have never run. I mean, think. I only did it. I only ran because they did a horrible job. And there was no unity, you had Ferguson. Look at what happening in St. Louis. Look at what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened in Oakland. Look at what hap- There was hatred all over the place. Now they so, ""oh wasn't that beautiful?"" What they did was, they did a terrible job. That's why I'm your president. Cause if they did a good job, I wouldn't have run. I had a very nice life [Laughs] believe me. I had a very ni -- And by the way, how many of these rallies have you- Stand up please. North Carolina, how many- What number is this? Don't be embarrassed. [Audience member calls out ""60""] Six oh? [Audience member response ""Six Oh""] 60! They have a group of 12 women and I see them a lot. And I say North Carolina, they remind me of the- no matter where we go and- So, 60, that's a lot, but that's only about 20%. So, you know, you have a long way to go. I'm sure their husbands are thrilled. [Audience member calls out ""Yes they are""] Where you going? I'm going to- Well at least here, you're close, right? [Audience member calls out ""1,000%""] And you mi- you don't mind right? [Audience member calls out ""No""] We like him. We like him. Great women. Thank you very much. That's really nice. Nah, that's really nice. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration's Trans-Pacific Partnership. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA, which is just now kicking in and has turned out to be incredible for our farmers, our manufacturers. Everyone said it couldn't be done. There's no way you could end NAFTA. I ended it. It was one of the worst trade deals ever made. I took the toughest ever action to confront China's rampant theft of American jobs. We've achieved energy independence. And we've done it while protecting our pristine environment. You know, we have the best environmental numbers we've ever had, meaning I guess, over 50 years ago. Because before that, you didn't have too much action, right? But we have the best environment numbers, ozone numbers, so many other numbers. In the meantime, China, Russia, India, all these countries, they're spewing stuff into the air. I keep telling my, our people, I say, ""You know, I love clean air."" But Russia and China, you look at them now. They have all these spots. And India, and many others, are spewing it in. What do you suggest? Well, we don't think you should sell straws anymore. Oh great, okay, that's going to help. You ever hear that, the straw, right? And I say, ""Okay, the straw is good, that's a little straw, that's third. Okay, let's..."" What about the plastic plate? What about the carton? What about the glass that's out of plastic? Well, we'll get to that later. These people are crazy. I recently signed an order placing a moratorium on off-shore drilling off the coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. So you don't have to worry about any oil spills in your beautiful land. You don't have to worry. Look how happy she is, I-, she obviously lives on the water. You don't have to worry about those spills. At the same time, I have made it so great for energy. You know, we've never had energy like we do. We're number one in the world now by far. And totally energy independent. In 2017 I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official governing policy, to buy American and hire American. I saw Biden the other day, he's standing here, like this. Know what, he's got a sign Hire America and I said, ""I've been saying that for 15 years."" It's amazing. And you know this one. When the Tennessee Valley Authority replaced part of its American workforce with foreign workers, I told the board chairman, ""Chairman, you're fired. Out, you're fired, chairman."" You know what he was making? This had nothing to do with me. He was making $8,000,000 a year. He's the highest paid government official, semi-government, it's like a private, semi-private deal. $8,000,000 a year and I said, ""You're fired."" And what happened is, uh, as soon as I said that, they hired all of the employees back from Tennessee and five other states, six other states. Mississippi. They're all back and they were great. They were great. So, we do our little things, right? We did that one and it was great. My opponent's immigration plan is the most extreme in the history of our country. Biden's plan would eliminate US borders by implementing nation-wide catch and release. That's catch. A murdered comes over, you catch him. What do you do? Well, not much. Most of them don't say they kill people, right? You catch them, you take their name, and you release them into our country. It was a big deal, it sounds easy, I ended it, but you want to see tough, go through courts, go through... But I ended it. I ended catch and release. One of the worst things. Now we release them. You know where we'd release them, release them back into their country. We don't release them into our country anymore. We say, ""Congratulations, we've got them."" Look at all those people standing up out there, wow, sorry. Sorry we didn't get you seats. Well, they're strong, they're strong people. They're from North Carolina. Making every community into a sanctuary city. This is their goal, and suspending all removals of any illegal alien no matter how bad they are. Murderers, rapists. They have a deal with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. He lost twice. Greatest loser of all time. He lost the first time, and he took it, then he lost the second time. Elizabeth Warren should have dropped out. I'd be running against him. That would be okay, I don't care. There'd be more energy, smaller base, more energy. But, it happened twice to Bernie. But I would really be watching and very careful because it would be the total nullification of US borders. They don't want borders. They want to have this country and what would happen would be our country would be overwhelmed with illegal immigration coming in. Your jobs, crime would go through the roof. And now, as I said, we have the strongest southern border in the history of our country. Over 400 miles of wall. The wall will be completed very soon. MS-13 and criminal cartels would have rampaged freely all over the country if it wasn't for ICE and Border Patrol. So, we've gotten rid of thousands of MS-13, we delivered 'em back out of our country. We said congratulations, here they are. You take 'em, we're not takin' 'em. These are bad, some bad people. If Biden wins your borders are gone which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone, and your safety is gone. It's very simple. Biden has pledged with Bernie Sanders, this, they made this agreement. You know what it is, they all agreed to a thing they call it the manifesto. My idea, it's called the manifesto. He's pledged to eliminate our requirement that newcomers to our society be financially self reliant. We want them to be able to make a pledge that they're not gonna take from us, and he'll provide unlimited welfare. He wants to, for anybody anywhere in the world that comes into our country. I said that's a great idea where we gonna get the money, sleepy Joe? Under my leadership we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we're finishing the wall. So, we're up to now 407, I think, 406, 407, we're doing 10 miles a week. Nobody believes it. We invested 2.5 trillion dollars in the U.S. military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared to more than 1 billion dollars a year, many times what it was, and by the way, all made in the USA. We have, uh, the greatest machinery ever made by any nation in history. Russia, China, everyone of 'em they're all jealous, what we have is, uh, not even to be talked about. I actually mentioned this in a rally about two months ago and they said he's giving away information. No, I'm not, I'm telling you somethin' we got stuff that they dream about, all made in the USA one, 2.5 trillion dollars, and you know what? Hope to God... We've redone our nuclear we're number one in the world by far. It was going down the tubes, it was old and tired but hope to God we never have to use it. Remember when I came in they said with his personality we'll have, we'll be in a war in the first week. Where's the, where's the war? Right. Where's the war? Remember, you would've been in a war without me 'cause North Korea we were gonna have a nice nuclear war with North Korea, and now I get along great with him, and everyone says oh that's terrible that I get along. No, it's a good thing. You know, getting along is a good thing not a bad thing, and you get along through strength not through weakness. You never get along through weakness. And we launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces, and I never even talked, when I came to North Carolina and talked to you I never said this. So, we actually did more than I promised. I'm the only politician, if you'd call me that. I'm the only politician that actually did more than I promised because I never talked about the Space Force, I never talked about it, right? And as I, you know, sat for a year and I watched and I saw what was going on with Russia, and with China, and with others. I said wait a minute, we're gonna fall way behind, we can't do that and we launched the Space Force, and Jim Inhofe, and some of the people in the Senate were fantastic, and the house. And we got it passed so we have first time in 75 years, think of that a new force and it's a big force and it's an important one. We passed VA Choice for our Veterans and VA accountability for our Veterans, nobody thought that could happen 42 years. And we took over 100% of the Isis Caliphate. When I came in it was mess, they were all over the place. We took over 100% and we killed the leader of Isis and founder of Isis, al-Baghdadi, they were after him for 15 years. And we took out the worlds number one terrorist the mass murderer of many American troops, and many other troops, and many other people, Qasem Soleimani, is dead. And I withdrew from last administrations disastrous 150 billion plus 1.8 billion in cash, can you believe that? Five plane loads of cash, figure that one. The Iran Nuclear Deal, a disaster, and, uh, you know, the first call I'm gonna get after we win, it's gonna be from Iran. Can we make a deal? 'Cause their country's going to hell with the sanctions, and all of the things we've done and they wanna make a deal. I said, why don't you wait till after the election. I said, but if you wait till after the election there's gonna be much tougher. But I said wait till after the election 'cause, you, you can't make a deal now, you gotta see if sleepy Joe because if sleepy Joe gets in you'll make the greatest deal ever made, and China will own us. Remember what I said. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Got it done. And we got it built, Mr. Congressman, uh. We got it built too. They wanted two billion dollars to build it. I said maybe we can do cheaper. I said, to my people, I said, you know the story. Find something, maybe we owned some land. We did. It had a building on it. So we were gonna spend two billion dollars, I said, well, let's renovate the existing building. Is it big enough? Oh, it's too big actually. And how's the location? Much better than the one we were gonna buy in Jerusalem. I said, I'll come back with a price. David Friedman, he was one of the most successful lawyers. Now, he's the ambassador to Israel. So he calls me up two days later, he says, sir, I think we can do it for $350,000. I said, David, so from two billion? I said, well what's the difference between the two billion version and the one, 350,000? He said, ""Sir, honestly, the 350 will have a better location. A better building. It's actually better."" Now who would believe stories like this, huh? And I actually told him, I did something, I think congressman, I've ever done in my life. I said, ""David, it's too cheap. It doesn't sound good. Make it more expensive please."" So he made it 500,000. Not bad, right? And we opened it up a few months later. So not only did we name Jerusalem, became the capital of Israel, we got the building built. This thing would've taken 10 years, 20 years. Would've cost five billion dollars. Would've been ridiculous. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been fighting over that for 52 years. And instead of endless wars, we're forging peace in the Middle East. I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. It's [Inaudible]. And now he's pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy your social security. And he would destroy all pre-existing conditions and you know it, and so does he. Biden's running mate, sponsored Bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have a 180 million people that love their private health care. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on [Inaudible] hottest regions, and surge refugee admissions, he's agreed to this with crazy Bernie, by 700%. Think of that. Does that sound reasonable? Opening the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism. I said, ""No, thank you."" He wants to ban school choice and charter schools. And in the second term, and I've already started, we will provide school choice to every parent in America. One of the most important [Inaudible]. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and limitless future. A limitless future for all Americans. And just in concluding, first of all, it's great to be with you on this gorgeous day. This is beautiful. Been a great stay. I mean, my granddaughter, you know what happened right? You know the name of my granddaughter? Carolina! Carolina. Am I allowed to say that to South Carolina cause I love them too. Can I maybe do a... Am I okay with that? Can I have you [Inaudible]. Now it's Carolina. Beautiful. Over the next four years, we'll make America into the manufacturing super-power of the world. And we'll end our reliance on China. We've already started. We're well on our way. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, foolish, stupid, foreign wars. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. That's what we have. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, already signed [Inaudible] in January, 1st. Don't give Biden the credit for it, please. He won't even know what it is. People say what did I do... And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs at levels that you've never seen before. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars and it'll be soon, and NASA is now the number one space center in the world by far, and it was, um, it was virtually abandoned when I took over. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ""In God we trust"", and that won't be changed. They took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance and they got absolutely disseminated, they put it back, they said, ""No, no. We didn't mean it."" And then they took it out a couple of other times, that's where they're going but it's not gonna happen, not even gonna come close. For years you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the great people of North Carolina. So again this is the most important election of our lives, maybe in the history of our country, so get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get out and vote. The red wave is coming. The red wave is coming. And remember early voting starts guess when, today, so go down there. From Wilmington to Winston Salem, from Asheville to Charlotte, from Greensboro to right here in Greenville, we inherit the legacy of North Carolina patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. We love our nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Patanal canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you haven't seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you help build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, and we are returning it fast, faster than anyone ever thought possible. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, we're proud. We will make America safe again, quickly, and we will make America great again. Thank you everybody. Go out and vote."
10,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Campaign Rally in Des Moines, Iowa ",October 14 2020,"[Audience chants ""USA""] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello, Des Moines. Oh, it's been a good time we've had Des Moines. I even bought a hat. They said, sir, it is so windy out there. I said, well, my hair's very powerful. It's very strong. It can handle it, but I bought it just in case. It may get pretty bad, but it's pretty windy. So thank you all very much and I'm thrilled to be back in the American heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking, Iowa patriots. And 20 days from now, we're going to win this state. We're going to win four more years in the White House. We're going to keep it that [Inaudible]. And I must tell you, you know, I've just, uh -- look, a poll just came out, we're up, six. OK, big deal. No, didn't we win by 11 or something? We're up, six and I'm up six, nobody has ever done for Iowa and the Farm Belt and the farmers and all. No more estate taxes, no more anything. I saved Ethanol. Ethanol is safe. For me, to only be up, six, I'm a little bit concerned. I'll tell you that because nobody is going to do for Iowa or what I did for Iowa. We've just learned through explosive documents published by a very fine newspaper, The New York Post, that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son's corrupt business dealings. [Audience boos] And this is a big smoking gun. The newly uncovered e-mails reveal that a top executive from the highly questionable Ukrainian company, it's an energy company which paid Hunter at least $50,000 a month, but it's now looking like it could be $183,000 a month. That's a lot of money. Would anybody in this audience take it? I'll take it. We'll take it. Despite the fact that he had absolutely no experience, knew nothing about energy, wrote to Hunter, arranging for a meeting to meet with Vice President Joe Biden. I've been saying this for a long time with that family, the same Ukrainian energy executive even sent Hunter an email saying quote, we urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence. In other words, Hunter was being paid for access to his Vice President father, who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia. [Audience boos] How about the Russia hoax? It turned out that they were the ones that did the Russia hoax. It was them. No collusion, no collusion. These emails show that Biden's repeated claim that he has never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings were a complete lie. It was a total lie. He lied to you over and over because he's trying to cover up a massive pay-for-play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency and everybody knows and everybody in Washington knows it. We've known it for a long time. The fact is, there was never an administration more corrupt than the Obama-Biden administration. There was never, never. [Audience boos] Just weeks ago, Joe stood before the American people in a Presidential debate and told you that these claims had been totally discredited and that his son did nothing wrong, but now that turns out to be a total lie. Now we can see clearly that Biden is a corrupt politician, who shouldn't even be allowed to run for the Presidency. I was pressing Joe Biden to tell the truth because the corrupt mainstream media, right back there, all those cameras right back there. [Audience boos] They're corrupt and they refuse to write the story. There wasn't one time in almost four years during my presidency, during the greatest political scandal in U.S. history, a witch hunt, a horrible, horrible disgusting witch hunt that should never ever happen to another presidency again. And people should pay for the crimes they committed, which turned out to be a total illegal hoax. That false and libelous stories every day, false and libelous stories, and they knew they were false, too. They knew they were false. They were never taken down by Twitter or Facebook or the mainstream media, never once. Yet with Biden today, they take negative posts down almost before they even go up. They're trying to protect him. They're trying to protect Biden. They take them down and I was just getting off that magnificent plane behind us, Air Force One. And I had heard -- I just don't know this for a fact, but they say, Kayleigh McEnany. You know Kayleigh, right? Kayleigh McEnany. Good, Kayleigh, she's so great. She's so incredible. They closed down her account. She's the White House Press Secretary, because she's reporting the truth, they closed down her account. So let's see what's going to happen. And did you hear the news? Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. Bruce Ohr, him and his wonderful wife Molly. She wrote all this stuff and then he goes and he works at the Department of Justice and he took it. Didn't he bring it to the FBI? The wife writes it, she gets paid a lot of money. Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. That's good. A couple of years too late, that's all. He should be, not only in the Department of Justice outbox, he should be someplace else, OK. Eight months after his alleged meeting with the [Inaudible] executives, so these, uh, Bermecia -- they say pronounce it Bermecia, a real beautiful company. Vice President Joe Biden went to Ukraine and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid if they did not fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son and the company that his son worked for. That's [Inaudible]. [Audience boos] The documents also show that before one of Joe's trips to Ukraine, Hunter emailed his business partners saying his lucrative contract should begin now. Think of that, should begin now. Right now, it's got to begin. It's a -- the whole thing is so incredible. Here's a guy -- look, let's just put it in simple language. He got thrown out of the military, that's unfortunate. He didn't have a job for a long time. His father becomes Vice President and he's making millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. Think of it. No, think of it. Think of it. It's like the Hillary stuff, the crooked Hillary and it's the crooked Joe. You know when a Democrat voter here in Iowa asked Joe last year. You remember his son raked in money in exchange for providing access. Joe called that man a damn liar, you're a damn liar. His kid's making millions of dollars. He had nothing, he didn't have a job, thrown out of the military, sadly, but thrown out of the military, and he knew nothing about energy. He knew nothing about investments, he knew nothing about China. How about he walked away $1.5 billion to manage for China. They don't do that with the most brilliant people on Wall Street. Vice President Biden, you owe the people of America an apology because it turns out you are a corrupt politician, OK? Joe Biden must immediately release all emails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, and records related to his involvement and his family's business dealings, influence peddling around the world, including China and including Russia -- including Russia. Hunter raked in a fortune from China. While Joe Biden was giving China all of our jobs -- they came -- you know where they came from, Iowa and plenty of other places, but they came from Iowa. He was giving them -- they were taking our jobs. They were taking our factories. They would take in everything. They would take in our wealth and I gave you $28 billion. Say, thank you very much, President Xi. It came right out of China and because of that, everybody's happy in Iowa. I just hope you remember that on November 3rd. I hope you remember. Nobody else would have done it. Nobody else would have done it. The Biden family treated the vice presidency as a for-profit corporation flying around the globe, collecting millions of dollars from China and Ukraine and Russia and other countries. In fact, the wife of the Mayor of Moscow, gave Hunter Biden a check for $3.5 million in cash while his father gave away the store to Russia, including Crimea, remember Crimea? The Biden's got rich while America got robbed. By contrast -- and this is so true and it's so easily true and I'm so proud of it in so many ways. I've given up billions of dollars to serve as your President and it's my greatest honor of a lifetime. That's -- it's so true. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] I ran for President because I could not sit back any longer and watch the terrible injustices being done to the American people and it's true. By the way, before the China plane came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world and now it's going right back there. Our stock market is very close to a number that was even higher. Does everybody have your 401(k) ready? Because it's going through the roof. We're going to have the best year we've ever had and we're going to have tax cuts, not tax increases. They want to increase your taxes. They want to increase your taxes, so they can spend it on the Green New Deal. [Audience boos] It's another beauty. I could not sit idly by and watch career politicians like Joe Biden continue bleeding this country dry and that's what it is. You know you can say whatever you want, you can say whatever you want, but when you have a kid that follows in his father -- and by the way, take a look at his brother. His brother, all of a sudden, he's building a big housing development in Iraq. Have you ever built a development before? No, I haven't. Take a look at the whole family. It's a corrupt family. Joe Biden personifies the selfless and corrupt globalists who got rich and powerful at your expense. Take a look at the people that are funding his campaign. People assumed that they'd be funding my campaign. I don't want them. We don't want them. We never needed them. We don't want them. But they betrayed American workers, disparage American values, and crushed our middle class. For decades, Biden and his cronies laughed while they shipped millions of your jobs to their friends in foreign countries and countries that you've never even heard of. They live behind gated walls and they flooded your communities with illegal immigration, deadly drugs, MS-13, savages that assault, rape, and murder, innocent Americans. [Audience boos] They forced our fellow citizens to live in crumbling inner cities while they spend trillions of dollars on never-ending foreign wars. They just never ended. But you know, we're bringing all our soldiers back home, you know that. We've been doing it for a long time and it's not easy, not easy. The military-industrial complex, not the easiest thing, but we're bringing it back home. We're almost finished in Afghanistan coming in, we're dealing -- we're down to a small number coming home by the end of the year. Hopefully, the end of the year, shortly thereafter. In Syria, we're out, totally out. And by the way, we crushed -- before I did this, we crushed 100% of the ISIS caliphate, 100%. We crushed 100%. We have the greatest military in the world. And by the way, we have built the greatest military in the world. So I just tell you, from Iowa, you know, you're a very powerful state, politically. You're a big state to me, big in your heart, but you have a tremendous influence and a tremendous power and you've never let me down. You just came in and we won by so much. You know, they say if a Republican wins by one point -- I think I won by 11, right, 11. That was early in the night, remember that? They said Donald Trump has won the state of Iowa. Then they said, man, he won by 11 points. What's going on? That was just the beginning. Then we won Ohio. We won Ohio by eight points. I said, what's going on? You know it's one thing you want to say, but when you win by a lot -- and that was the beginning of something. And I'll tell you what, we have more enthusiasm now than we ever did four years ago. That really is true. And we have great poll numbers. Although, you know, you see a lot of the fake poll numbers. They're doing -- they'll do anything they can. They're called suppression polls. [Audience boos] Yeah, there they go. Look, look at the red lights. They start to go off as they start to point. You know, in one way, they want the ratings and in another way, they don't want to have the ratings and you're telling CNN that they're a fraud and they're broadcasting. No, that was one of the greatest -- that was one of the greatest evenings ever. There are those who say it was the most exciting evening in the history of television -- the highest-rated evening in the history of television. And you know what, the election we have coming up on November 3rd is actually more important, actually more important. In 2016, you voted to fire the failed and decrepit political class and you elected an outsider as your President and I finally put America first. It's called make America great again. It's windy out here. If you can wear the hat, I can wear the hat. Yeah. Should I take off the tie or not? What do you think? I don't know. Maybe, yes? Oh, that feels so much better. That feels better, that feels good. Now we can all just relax and have a good time. No, but it's, uh -- it's great to be with you, seriously. We've had a great history here together. What we've done for you and what we've done for the farmers and what we've done for everything. You know, two weeks ago, you had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, right? Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country and the largest order of beef. But you know why? Because China wants to keep me happy, that's why. It was from China because they know what they've done to us should never have been allowed. They could have stopped it, they didn't stop it, they should have stopped it. The only reason I'm your President is because the previous administration did a poor job, so poor, in fact, that I said I'm going to run for President. And you know what, if they did a good job, I wouldn't have run and if they did a good job, then I guess, I wouldn't have won. When you think, I wouldn't have run and I wouldn't have won, but they were so bad and it turns out that was so totally corrupt. We did not come this far to overcome this much and fight this hard, only to surrender our country back to the depraved Washington swamp. You know, when I would say drain the swamp, I used to say, you know, drain the swamp and people liked it. I hated the expression. I hated it. I hated it. I -- this a hokey expression and I put it in one speech, the place went crazy. I said I'm starting to like that expression. Then I put it in another speech and they went crazy. I said, you know, I really like it. I really like it, but you know, when -- when I say drain the swamp, I had no idea the swamp was that dirty, that disgusting, and that deep. It's true. If I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, it's because I'm not a politician. And I don't want to insult our great politicians because we have some great ones with us tonight. But if I don't always play by the rules of Washington and Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you, harder than ever -- and I tell you what, I fight for you harder than any President has ever fought for anyone. It's not easy. But I love it because we're making tremendous progress, we're making tremendous progress. And the fact is, that no administration in their first three and a half years has ever done as much as this administration has done. You take a look at the [Inaudible]. And you know, it's amazing because they always challenge you. They challenge you on everything. They never even challenge me on that statement. I make that statement all the time and they just stand there like, uh -- they grit their teeth, they say he's right. We might hate him, but they say he's right. Right now, I'm fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy, and save our country from the radical left and that's exactly what we're doing. As a candidate, Joe Biden has made yet another corrupt bargain in exchange for his party's nomination. He has handed control to the Socialists and Marxists and the lunatic left-wing fringe that are really running that party. He's not running -- let's face it, Joe is shot, OK, whether you like it or not. We can all be nice. It's going to be my turn someday. It's even going to be your turn someday my friends. Someday, but you know, when it is your turn, you can't be President. One thing I've learned, President Xi of China is 100%, Putin of Russia, 100%, Kim Jong-un -- by the way, whatever happened to that war we were supposed to be in? Kim Jong-un of North Korea, 100%. These people are sharp and they're smart. Joe has lost it. In his best day, he wasn't a smart man. Everybody knows that, but Joe is gone. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country. They're addicted to power and God help us if they get it. We'll never be the same country and we will never be able to recover, and we are on a basis -- and I'll tell you something, the country was coming together. I was telling a very, very -- actually a very good reporter today that our country was coming together because we were having such success. That I was being called by people that normally I wouldn't be speaking to too much. They don't want me. I don't want them, but we had the best employment numbers in history: African American, Hispanic American numbers, women, Asian, everything, high school diploma, without high school diploma, colleges, PHDs, we have the best numbers in every category, 160 million jobs, we were never even close to that. We were at 160 million jobs and it was all coming together. People, let's get together, let's talk. You know, it's like splitting up the riches really and in a positive way, splitting up the riches and what happened is, we then got hit with the plague. And now, it's back to the drawing boards, but we're going to have a strong v -- the quarter, the third quarter is going to be incredible. When you see the numbers, not that I know anything because I don't want to give you inside information because I don't have it. They'll say he's giving away inside information. They are sick. But wait until you see the third-quarter numbers and it's going to be right before -- it's going to be right before the election -- before the November 3rd. Although a lot of people will have voted by that time. Get out and vote. You've got to get out and vote. You've got to get out and vote, but we're -- we were really coming together because, you know, look, ultimately, we want to come together, everybody come together. And we were really coming together and then we got hit by this horrible situation, could have been stopped. China stopped it from going into the rest of China, but they didn't stop it from coming out and going to Europe and the United States and the rest of the world, 188 countries. So we're now putting it together. We had it done and now we're doing it again and next year, we'll be even stronger than last year. Last year was the best year we've ever had and this coming year will be even better than last year. Unless somebody comes along who says, let's quadruple your taxes, which is what they want to do. They want to raise your taxes. They want to go with this ridiculous Green New Deal which, by the way, their original price, $100 trillion. You couldn't do it for that. If we did great, every year for 100 years, everything was perfect, right? No, nothing, no recessions, no anything, you couldn't make $100 trillion. These people are crazy and they actually mean it, you know. They actually mean it. So we're going to get it going to a level that nobody can ever turn course on us. Nobody can ever change. You know, I tell the story. For years, as a student of economies, I just love it. I love watching it, I love doing it, and I love seeing the results because the results have been so incredible. But as a student, I used to hear, for years, for 10 years, 2019, China -- because, look, let's face it. China's 1.4 billion people, we're 325 million, not including illegal immigrants that are in the country, frankly. And we don't even know what that number -- I said, how many do we have? We have no idea, sir. Well, I -- I have an idea. By the way, our Southern border is now stronger than it's ever been. But we have 325 million, 330 million people, but for years, I heard that China will overtake us as the world's largest economy in the year 2019. You've all heard it, I think, right? Yes, he's a very smart looking guy. You're loaded with money. I bet, look, that's why he's in the front row. He's in the front row and he didn't have to stand here for three days to get there. I can tell, this guy, but, right? In 2019 that China was going to overtake us. Well, you go back six months, seven months, not only were they overtaking, we were beating them by leaps and bounds and getting bigger and bigger and growing and growing and taxing them and taxing them and taking in billions and billions in tariffs. And when they targeted Iowa and the farmers of this country and ranchers and others, I said, no, no, no, you can't do that. No, no, you can't -- and I put in 25% tariff on everything and I gave a lot of the money. Well, I don't want to say it too loudly, $28 billion, I gave you $16 billion and $12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture. Great guy. Loves -- he knows more about farms. I said Sonny, what's the number? He said, two years ago, sir, $12 billion they hit us for and last year $16 billion. I said that's OK, we're going to put a 25% tariff. The farmers are going to get $12 billion and then they're going to get $16 billion, OK. And we're going to give that money to our farmers and that got our farmers even. In fact, I shouldn't tell you this because they don't like this, but some of the farmers were making more money the way that I was doing it then by working their asses off, all right. They were very, very happy, but no, we took care of farmers. No other Presidents can do that. No other -- that's why the -- that's why China got away with all of this stuff for years, and we had plenty of money left over after the $28 billion. It went into the U.S. Treasury, but they got away with it because they had threatened a President, like Obama, we're going to target your farmers, we're going to target the middle of our country, and Obama would say, I'll bet, we'd better not get involved. I said differently, I said if you do it, if you do it then, what we're going to do is, we're going to tariff your goods and we're going to give a lot of that money to the people that you're targeting. And you know, the thing that most impresses me about Iowa, Nebraska, and a lot of other states, if you look -- and by the way, Minnesota was so great, all of them, every one of them. Wisconsin was incredible. They never came to me and said, sir, you can't let this happen. They'll stop reordering, they're not ordering from us. They never said it. Do you know what they said? The President is right. At some point, we have to put up a stand and I didn't hear one even from fake CNN. They put people on television that said, I know it's not good, but the President is right. The President is right. You did the right thing. Because otherwise, it puts me in a bad negotiating position. You can't really negotiate. You know it's tough, it's tough. I never -- I'll never forget that about the farmers. It's incredible. The other thing I won't forget -- you don't mind if I go off script? This stuff is -- enough with -- enough with crazy Hunter Biden and making millions of dollars a day. He made it because of his great intellect. No, but -- but you know the other thing? Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? Is Hunter here tonight? Hunter? Hunter, congratulations on making a lot of money last year. Do you know the other thing I remember? In the White House, we had 36 farmers come to see me. I'll never forget it and they were getting hit really hard. This was two and a half years ago, early and they came in to see me. Almost all farmers and they said, sir, we're -- you know we're hurting, but you're doing the right thing, sir. I'll never forget this meeting, it's early. I've got pictures of it, many from Iowa, but from other states, but many from Iowa. And I never saw it because everyone's always asking me for money. I want money here. I want -- countries want money. Our so-called allies are always asking for money. Please defend us, even though then they rip us off on trade. You know we defend them and then they rip us off in trade. They're always asking for money. So the farmers are in and I said to them, do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to do a big thing. I'm going to get you a lot of money and I'm going to do for tariffs and I'm going to do this and I did it very early on in strategy and I'm going to subsidize you, guys. You're going to be so happy and I used a terrible word. They said, sir, may I speak? Yes, you can. What do you want to say? We don't want subsidies, sir. All we want is a level playing field. We don't want anything, all we want -- it's true. It's true, right? It's true. I never heard that. Most people, they don't care, call it subsidy, call it give me cash. Just give me money. The farmers said we -- and by the way, I could see there was like a chill in the room. I mentioned that word, I said, did I say something wrong? The farmers are unbelievable. They're the heart of this nation. They said we don't want subsidy. I'll never forget it. Sir, we don't want subsidy, we don't want that. We just want a level playing field, sir. We'll beat anybody. We want a level -- and it's -- to this day, I tell that story all the time because I don't hear that. Most people, they don't care, you can call it anything you want. You call subsidy, you call it anything you want. I just think you people are incredible, OK. That's it. Enough, enough of that. Enough of that. Enough of that, I'm going to make him cry and he hasn't cried in 40 years, that guy. One of the most important issues for Iowa is the whole thing that happened with Ethanol. They were killing Ethanol and Joe Biden's vowed to abolish fossil fuels. He supports all of the outside, you know, this crusade to eliminate gas-powered cars and his running mate sponsors the insane -- you know, she's the most liberal -- by the way, did Mike Pence beat her? Do you know the expression in boxing or as my friend Dana would say, UFC? If that were a fight, they would have stopped it, right? Mike Pence, we love Mike Pence and he loves Iowa, too. He loves Iowa. He just left. The Biden-Harris platform will demolish Iowa Ethanol, you know that, wiping out the entire industry. And we fought hard for it, you know, we went through the whole thing where we had no demand because of the pandemic. And we all fought hard to keep it going and keep the Ethanol going and we did the 12 months. You know, I did 12 months, remember it was eight months. I said why not 12? And they couldn't give me a very good answer, but I made it year-round and 15%, right, up from the 10%, 15% and it's great stuff. And when the market comes back, which is coming back. But in the meantime, you have an expensive gasoline. That's not so bad, right? That's not so bad. Because nobody ever thought that they'd see gasoline with a two in the front of it, unless. And we've saved all of our energy jobs and, whether we like it or not, when we are having a problem with energy, I called Russia and I called Saudi Arabia and they reduced production by more than 10 million barrels a day and our entire energy was saved all over the world, frankly. They're not doing it for us, but they're doing it for, let's say, everybody. And we have an incredible country and we saved our energy industry, our energy jobs, and we are energy independent and it's a beautiful thing. And by the way, I also made a little promise, most of you won't understand. For those people in the Ethanol world, you could use the pumps. OK, do you understand that? You can use the pumps. In other words, you don't have to go out and spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new pumps. Because you know with the additional Ethanol, the additional power, some people say, oh, make them buy new pumps. No, I don't want you to buy new pumps, you don't have to. So for those people that understood what I just said. You know what I'm talking about, right? Using the pumps that'll be OK. To defend our rights in our Constitution, I nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Right? And I'll tell you, you know, I don't mind running against sleepy Joe, but I wouldn't want to run against her right now. She has to promise. Please promise me, Amy, you'll never run. No, she's been great. She's so outsmarting these people, these people with bad intentions. If you look at some of the questions that are being asked and you're just -- they're so obvious. These are not great chess players, let's face it. Let's face it, they're not great, but then, they're horrible, just horrible, nasty, and she handles it like nothing. She's a great intellect. And one of the reasons she is a highly respected Professor, who's been teaching for many years, said she was the single greatest student that he's ever had and that sold me. You know I believe in that kind of thing. It's called intelligence. I believe in intelligence, but I just want to -- I haven't spoken to her in a few days. I want to just say that we made the right choice, right, with Amy. And speaking about making the right choice, you made the right choice a long time ago with a man named Senator Chuck Grassley and you made the right choice and you're going to do it again, I hope because she's great, Joni Ernst. And there, right now in Washington, fighting to confirm our great new justice, our future Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Joni has been fantastic and she's been fighting for Iowa values for a long time. She'll call me, sir, can we do this? She -- nobody called me more on Ethanol than Joni and Chuck. In fact, I used to duck their calls. Tell them I'm not in, just tell them I'm not in. I can't take it anymore, Joni, but that's what a good senator is. They want to keep your state going, they want to keep our country going, they love our country, they love our state that they represent. Senator Joni Ernst, you've got to get her in and Chuck Grassley. We don't have to worry about him. He'll be around forever. He's great. You know what I love about Chuck Grassley? He's got that voice, that great voice. Even when he's being nice, he sounds like the toughest guy, right? And he's being nice and he looked at Comey, remember? You know the corrupt FBI Director and he looks at Comey, he looks at Comey, corrupt guy, and he just said, did you leak? And Comey choked. Yes, I did. He said in the House and let's see what happens to him, but I'll never forget Chuck Grassley. And he didn't mean it to be mean, he just sort of like got that rough voice. Did you leak? Uh, uh, yes, I gave it to my college professor friend from Columbia, yes. Remember that? Oh, we love Chuck. What a piece of work he is. If Democrats win, they will pack the Supreme Court with radical-left judges [Audience boos] who would shred our Second Amendment. And believe me, if they win, your Second Amendment is gone, OK? [Audience boos] They'll empower violent mobs and shield deadly criminals and terrorists, very simple. Joe Biden refuses to even answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. How about this? They go up to him, do you want to pack the court? I'm not going to answer that question. Do you know why? Because they don't ask it. If he doesn't, you know, me, it would be like forget it. But they say, you were going to pack the court, sir. Uh, I'm not going to answer that because I don't want to say. Oh, OK, good next question, can you -- no, can you believe it? This is the essence of our country, we can't allow this to happen. And the other thing is, they don't ask the second. I put up a list of 45 great, brilliant, conservative, in our case, justices that go by the Constitution as written, etc., etc., OK? So he's got to put up the name of justices or judges, whoever he'd pick to become a justice of the Supreme Court. He's not doing that. They're not asking that question. They don't ask. Did you see the NBC thing last week where they had an NBC town hall? It was designed for a child, OK. When I get in, they ask me things that nobody ever even contemplated could be thought of. This guy, they're asking him these questions. Nobody can believe it. In fact, NBC took a lot of heat. They took a lot of heat. Biden's agenda would be a catastrophe for Iowa's seniors, everybody knows that. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. Do you remember that? You do know he wanted to cut your Social Security and Medicare. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty in federal healthcare for illegal aliens, decimating Medicare, and destroying your Social Security. And the problem is, we all have a heart. I say it all the time. I'd love to take care of everybody all over the world. The problem is, our country can't afford it and if you start saying we're going to give free education, we're going to give you Medicare, we're going to give you healthcare, we're going to give you everything. Our country will be flooded with millions and millions of people that are going to come from all over the world. They will decimate our country, you can't do it. Biden cares more about illegal aliens than he does for your senior citizens. It's true. Remember when they asked the question at the debate where the Democrats were up there. You had all these Democrats, they started off with 26. And in fact, I said, there's no way they'd pick Kamala because she treated him worse than anybody else and her poll numbers were dropping like a rock, right? But they asked, who is going to give money, healthcare to illegal aliens? And they all raise their hand. Remember Joe? He's looking around, aye, yay, yay, he didn't understand the question. He didn't -- you know, at least, he has an excuse because he has no clue what the hell they're asking. But do you remember his position? He was like this, their hands are all up. We're going to give all our money away. Forget about all you, people. That's a big crowd, by the way, look at that. Show it, show it, please. Turn those cameras, please. That's a beautiful crowd. That's beautiful. But remember Joe, so he's standing there, are you going to give healthcare to illegal immigrants? People that come into the country illegally, in other words, right? They come in illegally and under a plan, they have the manifesto. They want to give them a lawyer. That's what we need is more lawyers now, OK? They want to give them a lawyer. They want to give them education. They want to give them healthcare. But they ask the question and I said, wow, because I think they had like 26 people originally, but every one of them raised their hand, including sleepy Joe. And what happened is, Joe is like this, everybody other hand and Joe you could see his -- You know for 47 years, he's got the itch because he's like -- he knows this isn't going to work. He's saying to himself because, you know, there's still something left, not much, but he's saying to himself. That's a natural instinct, right? A political instinct and the head -- his shoulder went up and then his hand. So I don't know. I don't think I'm even going to hold it to him. I'm not going to hold him. I got enough. How about the no fracking? We will not frack. Do you understand me? We will not -- then he gets the nomination, goes to Pennsylvania, where they are reliant on energy and fracking, and the jobs. Hundred, probably nine hundred to a million jobs, right? He goes there, the day after he says, he's not fracking. He says we will frack, we will frack, and they don't hold it to him. If I ever did that, that would be the end, but never going to be the end for us either, is it, right, you know that. Never going to be the end because we have something going that nobody has ever had going. We have a relationship with the people that nobody's ever had, not because -- you know, I do think I'm a nice guy. You know a lot of people, they say suburbia, the suburban -- I've saved the suburbs. I've saved the suburbs. Then, I heard I'm not doing well with suburban women, OK. I got rid of -- no, it's true, they say that. But of course, they said that last election, too. He will do terribly with women, terribly. And then when I did great with women, they said, man, he did well with women. Same thing is going to happen. You know what I find? Suburban women period. They want security, they don't want their home values going down. They don't want a low-income housing project built in the middle of suburbia next to their house. And we have a rule that's a disaster, it's a regulation, and I said to Ben Carson -- some people, I say I want to terminate. They looked at me and they go, well, we can amend it. I said you don't understand, I want it terminated. You all know about it. It's a disaster, where they change the zoning and they make it impossible and you end up with low-income housing all over the place. And remember this, 29% to 30% of the people living in suburbia are minorities, so this has nothing to do with discrimination. It has nothing to do with anything. What it has to do is with the American dream, the American dream. We're not going to destroy the American dream for stupid people like Cory Booker and he was putting Cory Booker in charge. How about that one? [Audience boos] That's a beauty. Yeah, he did a great job as Mayor of Newark, New Jersey. That worked out, how's -- how's Newark doing? This election is a choice between Trump recovery at a level that nobody's ever seen before and a Biden depression. If they get elected, they're going to double and triple and quadruple your taxes. You will have a depression, the likes of which this country has never seen before and that probably includes 1929, OK? And one thing we learned about the farmers, they don't do well in depressions, do agree? They don't do well. Nobody does well in the Depression. You will have problems like you've never had before. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and by the way, for those states, open up your states. Open them up. Watch on November 4th, November 4th, all these Democrat Governors that have lockdowns, right? You know, I always said, I said right at the beginning. I think it was me that came out first. You know they're probably going to say, 20 years ago somebody said the same thing, but I said the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. And if you look at what's happening with these lockdowns to children -- get the children back to school. Like, I'll give you an example, the children, 99.9%, uh, Barron Trump. You know he had -- he had the corona-19, the China virus. It's got 21 different names, I could go over it, but to me corona means Italy. China is China and it came from China, so he had the China virus, right? And he had it for such a short period of time. I don't even think he knew he had it because they're young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off 99.9% and Barron is beautiful and he's free, free. Like my wife, our first lady who loves Iowa, by the way. Our -- our first lady, she put out that Barron has tested positive and I said, wow, and we talked about it. I said you put it out you're -- you know it's like personal stuff, but you really have it. I said, yeah, let's put it out, Barron's tested positive. Within like two seconds it was Barron is just fine now. He's tested negative, right? Because it happens, people have it and it goes. Get the kids back to school. We've got to get the kids back to school. Get them back to school, all right? Get them back, get them back. And when I had it -- you might have read, maybe most of you don't know this, but I had it, too. I didn't love it, but you know -- you know, it's a little tough and you have a temperature and you don't feel good. And then the scarier part is, you know, where's it going? It's fine, you're at a 101 or 102 and then you say, I don't love this. You haven't had a temperature in years and then all of a sudden you have it. But you see what happens to people and I went to the hospital and it's an incredible hospital, Walter Reed. I've seen what they've done because I've been there many times for our great warriors that come back so badly wounded and these doctors are incredible. And one thing when you're President, I'm laying in this bed, not feeling my best, and I'm surrounded by 12 doctors. One's the Head of Johns Hopkins, one's the Head of Walter Reed, One's the Head -- these incredible doctors. And I looked at the alternatives, all things we developed in the last seven months and one of them is Regeneron and I said, I'll take that one because it -- very early in the testing, but it had great numbers. And I'm telling you, they gave me this and they call a therapeutic. To me, it's a cure because I felt like Superman the following morning. I felt like I made a speech about a day later. Two days later, somebody said he looks better now than he did two weeks ago. What the hell is going on? So this is what's happening, we're really -- we're making tremendous progress. The vaccines are coming out very soon. A lot of great things are happening on that front, but a lot of great things are happening for our country. I'm working to make the antibody treatment that I received to, uh -- I want to give it to all of the people that qualify for it. People in hospitals, people just before they go to hospitals. We'll clean out our hospitals. Eli Lilly makes a very similar drug ad. We're going to do it free. We're going to do it free. It's not their fault, we're going to do it for free. So we're in the process of getting an emergency. It's called Emergency Use Authorization and we're going to Regeneron and the Eli Lilly comparable drug. We're going to give it to everybody and I hope they have the kind of luck that I have, but maybe I would have been perfect anyway. I like to say I didn't need it. I would have been perfect anyway because I'm so strong. You know I said that. I said sarcastically, I said, well, I'm in no danger because I'm in perfect physical shape and I'm very young. And CNN goes and reports President Trump lied to the American public. They said, can you believe this? This is this, uh -- this is what I was telling last night. We had an incredible rally in Pennsylvania. Oh, They were doing it to CNN. I thought they were doing it to me. We don't have too many of them anymore. Do you ever notice? You know at the beginning, when we started we would always have the phony people that stand up and you know raise their voice. They go home to mom get balled up. I don't know. I shouldn't be talking about this because all of a sudden, we have -- but we don't have that anymore. I learned about the cameras because the cameras never like your -- look at that. Look where that crowd goes, look where that crowd goes to all the way back to the buildings. And I'm always telling, I never thought the cameras could move and then I just noticed, whenever we had a troublemaker in the audience, they'd spin around, they'd be in like a pretzel, right? They could do anything, these guys. I thought they were like rigid. You know like a rigid piece of steel, they don't turn. But if we had in the backroom behind the pillar, somebody that camera would be turned around like a snake 15 different angle. But -- that sounds good. That's a brand new F-35 fighter jet. You can't see it. They say it's the greatest plane in the world. And by the way, speaking of that, our military, when I came in, the world's most overrated General told me, sir, we have no ammunition because we may have had a conflict very early in. And I said no President should ever hear that. And we have rebuilt our military $2.5 trillion all made in the USA with equipment like that, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia and China and any other country. We have equipment that nobody has. Our missiles, our rockets, our nuclear has been totally upgraded, and pray to God we never have to use it because I see what happens. Pray to God, but if we didn't have that, we could be in very big trouble. It's a very tough situation. But you look at the new tanks that we've ordered from Ohio, by the way. We kept the Lima, the Lima plant. I said keep it open. They were going to close it. I said keep it open. Before I became President I said keep it open because I visited. I said you could never build a plant like this. You could never get the people to make the tanks and we're going to be ordering tanks. We've totally rebuilt our military. We have the greatest missiles, rockets, tanks, fighters, bombers, tankers, ships in the world, all made in the USA. [Audience chants ""USA""] You can be proud of your country. Look at this young handsome -- this young handsome farmer. Are you going to be a farmer someday? Are you going to be a farmer, huh? He goes, hell, yeah. I'd like to be a farmer, too, sometimes. Don't I? We're joined tonight by some incredible friends and great people. Your Governor who's done an incredible job, Kim Reynolds and Kevin, her husband. Where's Kevin? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, really great job, Kim. How are we doing, by the way, OK? We're looking good? That's good. Thank you for everything, Kim. As well as, Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg. Adam, thank you. Thank you very much, Adam. Great job. Iowa's Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Naig. Mike, where's Mike? Thank you, Mike. Iowa's Senate majority leader, Jack Whitver. Thank you. Do you see the way they all stay together? They like each other. Speaker of the Iowa House -- oh, you've got to tell me this. This is good genes, I think, right? There are genes involved here, right? Pat Grassley, right? Good genes. What's the relationship, Pat, huh? That's good stuff. You got good stock. I want to bet on that guy in the future. Thank you very much, great job. I hear you're doing a great job. We're doing, all right? Good. Thank you, Pat. Ambassador Terry Branstad. OK, can I -- do we have time for one quick story about Branstad, OK? Because his son Eric is even better than him, but I'm not going to talk about it, and here's a guy that doesn't mind me saying. You know a lot of fathers they get angry if you say that. Oh, I'm better than my son. Those are not great fathers. This guy's proud. His son is great, but when I met Terry, it was long before I thought about this. And I heard the Governor of Iowa is in New York and he wanted to see me, and I said, oh, what the hell do I want to see the Governor of Iowa for? And I'm putting up buildings and I'm saying all right and I invited him. Before I ever thought about really doing this, you know early on, at least. And he came up and a humble guy, great guy, handsome guy that face, right? And he sat down, I figured I'd give him like five minutes. Kim, no longer than that, five, and I ended up spending an hour and a half. I said that is the smartest Governor. And then I learned, and as you know, he was the Governor for 24 years. That's an all-time record in the United States, right? Twenty -- 24 years. And -- and he told me a story in the first meeting. That I was before I think that I was even thinking about doing this. And again, it's only because Obama and Biden were so bad. I said let me do it. I wish I didn't have to, but I'm having a lot of fun because we're making such progress. But he told me a story, he said you know many years ago, I met a man in China because he was selling corn. Can you believe it, right? Corn, crops and he was selling corn and he said to his wife -- this is 35, 40 years ago. He said I met a man in China and went home to my wife and he said you know, I just met the next President of China many years forward, but I just met a future President of China. And I said who was that? It was President Xi who is now the President of China. And I said, you've got to be kidding and he said, nope. I could tell right from the beginning he was different and he was -- I'm not happy with what's going on just -- but -- he said I just met the next President. And then I remembered that story and then I ran and he was so incredible to me in Iowa and he wanted us to win. And his son was very much in charge of what we were doing and it worked out great, and then we won by a lot and then we won the whole thing. And I said you know, we have to pick somebody really smart for China and I said you know, the Governor of Iowa came to me and told me that story and I told him, I said, how would you like to be Ambassador to China? And he said, sir, I've been doing this for 24 years. It would be an honor. And I have to tell you this, he represented us great with China. He represented us great. I never told that story, I never told that story. But about a month ago he called he said, sir, I want to come home now. I want to make sure you get re-elected. I want to come home and he's out there. I know he's out there working, but we love him. He's a special guy. We've got a couple of real beauties with Grassley and with this guy. I'll tell you, what a couple of great people. Thank you very much for everything. Great job you did as Ambassador. The only question I have is, do we call you, Mr. Ambassador or Mr. Governor, what do you like? He said either one's OK. That's him. Anyway, thank you very much. Great job. I want to introduce another one who is one of the best, maybe the best in the whole country. He's the Chairman of the Iowa GOP, Jeff Kaufmann. You look good, Jeff. You lost weight, Jeff. You lost weight, I'm proud of you Jeff. You do a great job. How are we doing? He said Iowa's ours. Always be careful. He said Iowa is yours. I said never say that. The last one, you know, Beto, remember when he said -- he was running for President. He was doing OK and he was on the cover of a third-rate magazine called Vanity Fair, and he made the statement. I was born to do this. I said that's the end of his political career. I was -- he was born to do it. That didn't work out. Uh, I hear we're doing great. Thank you very much, Jeff. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Congressional candidate, a star, a guy who's going to be fantastic, David Young. David, thank you. You've got a lot of good candidates. We're also joined by a very special guest, one of the greatest wrestlers in American history. You know that, right? He's an unbelievable guy. I've known about him for a long time. Do we all love, Jim Jordan, our Congressman, right, right? Jim Jordan -- Jim Jordan is a great wrestler, a great NCAA champion and all. A lot of people don't know that, but Jim -- and Jim's from Ohio, but he says the greatest of them all is a guy named Dan Gable? Do you ever hear of Dan Gable? And listen to this, I mean I have to tell you. Is Dan here? I hope. Come here, Dan. Come on, come on. Look at this, you mean I can't take this guy in a fight. Can you believe it, huh? Wow, wow, come here, come here. Hey, Dan, I'm immune and I can't give it to you, so that's good. We love you. So -- but I met Dan a few years ago and I looked at him and I said, how come he's won 181 and one? Think of it. He won 181 and -- people don't know like that's like crazy, 181 and one. I'm going to ask you later on, who's the one? I want to find out who? But he did something else, he won the Olympics 1972. And to do that, he had to wrestle against the six greatest wrestlers in that weight class in the world and he did something never did -- done before. He didn't yield, one point throughout the whole thing and he ended up beating in the Olympic finals for the gold medal. He beat the great Russian wrestler, didn't get a point. He went through the whole thing, nobody got a point, and I'm looking at him and I'm saying to myself, I'm telling you I could take him, but I better not try it. But Dan has been inducted into the USA Wrestling Hall of Fame, the U.S. Olympic Hall Of Fame, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, and the United World Wrestling Hall of Fame, and he's become University of Iowa's all-time most winning coach. In fact, Jim Jordan said he was as great a coach as he was a wrestler. He won many -- how many championships that you won as a coach, too? 15. And I come from a town -- we have the Jets, they never win. You have the Mets, they never won. He won 15, that's called talent. It's called extraordinary talent actually. And what I did is, I thought about it, I thought about it long and hard, we're very selective. So the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the two greatest awards you can get in our country and I'm proud to announce that I will be awarding very shortly at the White House, in the Oval Office, coach Gable, the Presidential Medal Of Freedom. Say something, Dan. Wow, that's humbling. That's humbling because that's the highest honor. I'm used to winning and I have to do it and on the mat. But because I did it so many times on the mat and in other places, that I'm actually getting some other awards where I can just do it and they give it to me. See the thing about this guy is, I've coached a lot of athletes over all the years, and I'll tell you what, when I look at them and I hear them, it kind of reminds me a little bit of this guy right here. And -- and every one of them, you had to mold. Every one of them, you had to learn a little bit more. They had to get better and every one of them did, and that's why they were not just one-time champions. This guy's already a one-time champion. But because he's open for learning and he's already very competent that he's going to be a multi-champion President of the United States of America. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] Well, he's the pride of Iowa and he's -- he's great. You know you always try and figure out what makes a champion because you look at him, nice guy, good looking guy, all that stuff. But why is he 181 and one? Why is he a gold medalist? That's not something that nobody ever did. Didn't allow one point of any of these wrestlers and they're all the best in the world, the toughest. And there's just something different and you'll probably never figure it out. It is with great champions, you see it and you see it all the time with great champions, but there are very few. Jack Nicklaus, you see it. Tiger got the same award. When Tiger won the Masters a few months ago, I said you know what, that's an incredible thing he did and we gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom and he said it's one of the greatest honors. He actually said it's his greatest honor. I said, Tiger, you deserve it. You know he went through a lot and he came back, but you have great champions and they're different and nobody knows why. That man is different and he's a champion and it's an honor to present you to the people that love you most, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now we're doing it again. We've got a V-shape, we're going to see some very big numbers, and you're seeing it. In my first three years, family income increased by $6,000. That's more than 5 times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. African-American income grew 9 times more than it did under Biden and Obama. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty, so proud of that. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American unemployment, and Asian-American unemployment all reached the lowest levels in history. At the end of the last administration, the Congressional Budget Office projected fewer than two million jobs would be created over the next three years and we crushed that prediction and created almost 8 million jobs. Nobody can believe it and we're doing it again. My policies have benefited those who needed it the most. The bottom 50% of households saw an astonishing 40% increase in net worth. After our tax cuts, wages grew fastest for the nicest -- I mean it makes me feel so good, blue-collar workers. They were the ones that had the biggest benefit from what we did. Since the China virus, we have created a record 11.4 million jobs, that's a record. We've never created jobs at a level at which we're creating them now. We've already cut the unemployment rate in half, we're down to 7.8%. Sounds high, but a lot of people said we're going to be at 42%, we're down to 7.8%, and going down rapidly. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost, 30 months. We did it in five months. Jobs have been recovering. Think of this. Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama-Biden recovery, 23 times faster, not 23%, 23 times faster. I've spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He supported NAFTA, a disaster. Now you have USMCA, it's the best. It's now kicked in. He supported TPP, it would have destroyed your farms, it would have destroyed everything, and our auto industry would have been gone. And he supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, a catastrophe for our nation. You know China tries to get away with the fact that they are a developing nation, not anymore. If Biden wins, China wins. That's what's going to happen. If Biden wins, China will own our country. They'll own it. [Audience boos] And if we win, Iowa wins and America wins, and we're going to win for a long time. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA, where they belong. And as I mentioned, one of the things that was very important to me was to eliminate the very unfair estate tax or death tax on small businesses and farms. So now, if you love your child and you're a farmer and you think he's doing a great job or she's doing a great job, and she wants to keep the farm or he wants to keep the farm. There is no more estate tax where they have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay the tax. Is there anybody here who has a child to which they do not want to leave the farm because they don't like their child? Because -- raise your hand, please. Does anybody have the courage? There's one person over there. He says he's only kidding. No, -- but it's a big thing. I mean look, it's a big thing. A lot of farms are put out of business, the parents they pass away. They leave the farms to the son or daughter to the family and the family has to go out and borrow a fortune. And then they have a little bad season, a couple of bad seasons and they end up losing everything. We don't have that anymore. We don't have -- we cut the estate tax. It's out, gone. These are things a lot of people don't even know. We've got that along with the tax cuts, we've got that. Biden wants to repeal our tax cuts and massively raise taxes on your family farms. And what we did was hit the -- you know this, I mean you, you know exactly. We hit it so quickly. We hit so hard, we hit so strong on this whole tax situation because the farmers were being untreated -- were being treated unfairly, so unfairly with respect to taxes. I quickly issued a major disaster declaration and I will be with you every step of the way. And I don't think, Kim, will say this, your Governor. When you had floods all over the place, you were like a large-scale swimming pool. I hate to say it Iowa. I looked at the pictures that your Governor sent. I said, Kim, I never knew that this was oceanfront property and we took care of you, right? We gave you everything you needed and we got rid of all of the -- we've rebuilt the dams and the dikes, right? And we rebuilt it and we rebuilt it fast. My opponent has put forward a radical plan to eliminate U.S. borders by implementing catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and suspending all removals of illegal aliens. So if you have somebody that's a murder or a rapist, we can't do it. They agreed with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. There's nobody that knows how to lose like Bernie. Four years ago he lost, he went home happy. He lost again because Pocahontas refused to get out of the race. Otherwise, I would have been running against Bernie. I don't know which is better. That would have been a lot more enthusiasm for Bernie, smaller base, more enthusiasm, but he got out. I'll tell you. We're going to get a lot of the Bernie voters because they don't like Joe and they love our policy on dealing with other nations because they love our policy on trade because they -- they understand. They happen to understand that, but they also know we can do something about it. Bernie would have never -- never been able to do that. The United States would be completely overrun in a matter of days. Under my leadership, we achieve the most secure border in U.S. history and we are finishing the wall. It's now over 400 miles long. It's already built, and as I said, Mexico is paying for the wall. You know we did more -- one of these fake reporters said it. We did more -- one of the only politicians that's ever run -- forget about politicians. But one of the only politicians ever run that actually has done more than he or she has promised. As an example, I campaigned a lot in Iowa. I never mentioned the words Space Force, but when I got into office I realized I looked at Russia. I looked at Kim Jong-un. I looked at China. I said we need a Space Force and we got Space Force. I never talked about it on the campaign trail. We also passed VA Choice for our great veterans and VA Accountability, things that they said were impossible to get done. So now, instead of waiting online for weeks and weeks, if they have to wait, they go out to a doctor. We pay the bill and it's been a great thing, 91% approval rating in the VA. They're doing a great job over there. Think of it, I mean I shouldn't be telling you this because they'll find a vet someplace that's unhappy, but think of it. All our lives, we used to see on the evening news, horror shows with the vets and the vets and the vets, and it's terrible what they're doing. You don't see any stories about the VA, you don't see any stories. We have done 91% approval rating by the vets for the VA, the job we're doing. And we defeated 100% -- you know, we're bringing our soldiers home, but we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq. And when I took over, it was a mess. And we killed the leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for years and years. And we then took out the world's No. 1 terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many other troops and many other people. Qasem Soleimani is dead, dead. One of the biggest things to happen in the Middle East in 50 years. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear catastrophe, $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. That deal's practically expiring now, anyway, if we didn't terminate it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And you know that Presidents have been talking about that for decades. Every President said they were going to do that. Then they never had the guts to do it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and that's been 52 years they've been talking about that. I got it done in about two hours. And instead of endless war, we're forging peace in the Middle East. So I get nominated for three Nobel Peace Prizes, different subjects. And I told the story the other night. I was in Florida, we're in Pennsylvania. I told our first lady, darling, we're going to have the greatest publicity I've ever had tonight. I got nominated for the Nobel Prize. Do you know what that is, darling? Let's go home. So I leave for the first time in a long time, early. I get home. I turn on the television. They talked about your floods in Iowa. They talked about, how's Iowa doing with the crops? How is this happening? How are they doing in Florida? How are they -- three, four stories, one after another. Where is my Nobel Peace Prize? They don't talk about it. I said you know, darling, this news is a little tough. It's a little tough to crack. When Obama got his Nobel Prize, it was so early. He didn't even do anything. He still doesn't know what he got it for. They said, why did you get it? He said I have no idea and it was the biggest story. It was all over the place. With me, I got three and they got three nominations. Nobody talks about it. So, at least, I figured I might as well mention it, right? Kim, I should mention it, right, Kim? Kevin, right, Kevin? Kevin stand up, please, Kevin. There's the guy. They went on a hunting trip, my son, Don. He loves hunting and he went, Kevin, Don, and about 300 of the Governors, your previous -- Terry, your previous Governors, his friends, and they all went hunting. It was like 25 degrees below zero. The only two guys that stood out there the whole time were Kevin and Don Trump, Jr., and they came back. Everyone else was back in about 15 minutes, right, they're all back, and they wanted to go back into the lodge, to hell with this. And after a weekend, my son comes back and Kevin comes back, and you two guys didn't even know what they were talking about. You didn't know what the problem was, right? People don't know that about Don and they don't know that about -- but Kevin is fantastic. Thank you, Kevin, for being here. I appreciate it. He's a real -- he's a real guy. So I'm ending the old wars and Biden will lead us into new wars and we did more in 47 months than Biden did in 47 years and that's a fact. And if you look at the Democrats, they're pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a Presidential nominee. Their plan would destroy Social Security, destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. You know I got the travel ban. Everyone said, oh, that's not nice. I said really? It's not nice to come up and blow up cities either, is it? We won in the United States Supreme Court and he wants to end it. And surge refugee admissions by 700%, meaning, 700% opening the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism. No, thank you. No, thank you, sleepy Joe. [Audience boos] He'll ban school choice and he'll ban charter schools, very important places and it all starts -- you know Civil rights all starts with the education and we need school choice. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. We've already started, we've already started. You know it's an incredible thing because it's great education for less money. It's sort of a crazy thing. Less money, great education. And just to sort of finish up, a vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It's already happening. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, we have never ever been even close to as strong as we are right now, greatest equipment ever in our history, and we will ensure peace through strength. And if you remember when I ran this -- I know he's a very militant kind of a guy. We'll be in a war the first week. Well, where's the war? Where's the war? And I'm making other countries pay because, you know, NATO, they weren't paying their bills. They were delinquent to use the New York real estate term. They weren't paying their bills. I said you've got to pay. The Secretary-General of NATO is my single biggest fan. They're paying $130 billion a year more now because I said, look, you've got to pay, you've got to pay. They rip us on trade and then we're supposed to protect them, the European Union. So NATO -- so they're paying $130 billion more going to $410 billion more each year. So that's it. Where are the wars? He's going to get us into a war. Where are the wars? They don't want any part of us. Nobody wants any part of us in the world. They we're tired of being ripped off as a country. We will end surprise medical billing -- we will -- do you know the surprise medical billing is a disaster? It's ending as of January 1st, require price transparency, all signed, all done, January 1st. Can you imagine if I lose and I've done all these things, they kick in on January 1st? You're going to say, boy, that Biden's done a great job with price transparency. And they'll say, what do you think? And he has no idea what the hell it is, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. We went through a favored nations clause so that we will pay the lowest drug prices in the world, OK. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And you know, when I took over, NASA was basically closed. It was shredded, it was nothing, and now it's the No. 1 preeminent space center anywhere in the world by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust, and it won't change. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Iowa. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your workers and co-workers, and get the hell out to vote. Because if I don't get Iowa, I won't believe that one. I may never have to come back here again if I don't get Iowa. I'll never be back. Do you understand that, Kim? I will say this, there has never been a President has done more for farmers and ranchers, for the Farm Belt, for Iowa, there's never been a President that's even come close to what I've done. And I will say that and I'll say it loud and clear. I'll say that loud and clear. From Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids to Rock Rapids, from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, we stand on the shoulders of Iowa patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We inherit the legacy of American heroes. Nobody has anything more than what you have so much. Look at yourselves and look where you've come. Look even in the world of politics, Iowa, it's Iowa. And by the way, as long as I'm here Iowa, and I made this pledge to you four years ago, Iowa will always come first in the rotation. You know what that means, right? There's a lot of pressure. Let's put them back. I said, no, you're not putting them back. Do you know why? Because that's called the opposite of cancel culture. That's called a great American tradition. Iowa will always be No. 1, OK? you can forget it. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continents, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. So much you've done. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens, like you, helped build this country, and together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we are one movement, we are one people, and one family, we are one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Iowa, we have made America wealthy again, we have made America strong again, we have made America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much."
11,"Speech: Donald Trump Holds a Campaign Rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania ",October 13 2020,"Hello, Johnstown. Thank you very much. This is going to be a great evening. Incredible to be back in Pennsylvania, the proud home of American independence, the American Constitution, and American freedom. That's true, huh? What a history. And 21 days from now, we're going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we're going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins, all these other countries win, we get ripped off by everybody. [Audience Boos] If we win, you win, Pennsylvania wins, and America wins, very simple. For years, the selfish and corrupt political class betrayed the people of Pennsylvania, you know that, and the people of our country. Career politicians like Joe Biden lied to you. I don't think he knew he was even lying. If you want to know the truth, he's gone. He's shot, folks. I hate to tell you, he's shot. He abused you, he crushed you, your dreams, outsourced your jobs to China and distant lands all over the world. As a Senator Biden's last, American trade policies were a total disaster. They dismantled your steel industry and decimated entire towns in your area. And we brought back steel and we put tariffs on steel and we stop dumping steel and aluminum. As Vice President, he closed down 10,000 factories while raking in cash from corporations that move jobs overseas and his family got rich, you know that. [Audience Boos] How did Hunter make $3.5 million from the Mayor of Russia, Mayor of Moscow's wife? How did that happen? So you have the Mayor of Moscow, got a wife, gave Hunter $3.5 million bucks. I wonder what he did for that money, huh? The fake news they refused to talk about it. They don't want to hear about it. [Audience Boos] Biden's a servant of the radical globalists, the wealthy donors, the big money special interest who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, and you know it because you really suffered right this area. Threw open your borders and ravaged your cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these ridiculous endless foreign wars. They're all coming back home, don't worry. They're all coming back home soon. They're already on their way. They've been on their way for a long time. In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this failed and decrepit political establishment and you elected an outsider as your President to finally put America first. Well, we did. And we did not come this far, overcome this much, and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the depraved Washington swamp. And by the way, did we catch them? We caught them, we caught them, we caught them. Watch what happens, watch what happens. They spied on our campaign. What they did, what they did should never ever be allowed to happen to this country again, never. Watch what happens. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party's nomination. He has handed control to the socialists and Marxists and left-wing extremists like his Vice Presidential candidate. That's another great one, isn't it? [Audience Boos] I just watched her on television coming in because the great thing about Air Force One, we have more televisions. They're in closets, they're all over the place. There on the floors, on the ceilings, and I watched her, and I compared her to Amy, great future Supreme Court justice. [Audience calls out ""Fill that seat""] And I will tell you, Amy has made a great impression. [Audience chants ""Fill that seat""] And you know Biden, he can't stand up to the lunatics running his party. He can't even find his way off the stage without him -- look, look, what's happened. Yesterday, he didn't know the name. He said, you know the guy, I think he's a Mormon, right? He said he's a Mormon. He was talking about Mitt Romney but forgot Mitt Romney's name. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine? Then, he didn't know where he was. He said where am I? Where am I? No, he's shot, folks. He shot. I'm running against the single worst candidate in the history of Presidential politics and you know what that does? That puts more pressure on me. Can you imagine if you lose to a guy like this? It's unbelievable. It's uh -- it's disgusting, it's disgraceful. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country. He won't be running the country. The radical left will take over. And how about Pennsylvania? So he says there will be no fracking, no fracking. [Audience Boos] This went on for a year and a half, no fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then, Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So they stole another one from Bernie. Bernie's the greatest loser of them all. This guy, every four years, they steal it. So she refused to get out, Pocahontas, she refused to get that, right? They wanted me to apologize for saying the word Pocahontas. So, no, no, I apologize to Pocahontas, to the real one. No, no, she wouldn't get out and she took enough votes away and Biden won Super Tuesday. That shouldn't have happened. But if I don't sound like a typical Washington politician, fortunately, that's because I'm not a politician, I'm not a politician. But think of it. You know, you talk about politicians, no fracking for a year and a half, right? And then he goes to Pennsylvania says no, no, there'll be fracking like nothing happened. Can you imagine if I did that? No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. I'm the opposite, by the way, no fracking, no fracking. Then you win and you go, you know, I've got to go a little to the other direction, a little bit to the right, but he actually went further left, which is sort of an amazing thing. But all of a sudden he comes out in favor of fracking. And let me tell you, it's always the first thing that turns out to be true, OK? They will lose, you will lose in Pennsylvania, a million jobs. There will be no petroleum products. There will be no fracking whatsoever. And did you see his party now is really angry at him because he's saying maybe they'll be fracking? It's a very conditional, you know, it's a very weak -- but with me, you're going to frack, you're going to frack. And you're going to keep your energy low and we're independent. You know, we are now energy independent first time ever. So if I don't always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it's because I was elected to fight for you and I fought harder for you than any President has ever fought for their people. Right now, I'm fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy, and save our country from the radical left and that's a big thing, saving it. Because these people -- this will end up being a large scale version of Venezuela if they get in. [Audience Boos] They don't have water, they don't have medicine, they don't have food, they don't have anything. Despite everything they've thrown at us, we've done more in the first three and a half years than any administration in history and the best is yet to come. It's true. A recent Gallup poll just came out. [Audience chants ""Four more years""] Thank you. A Gallup poll just came out that found that 56% of Americans say they're better off today than they were under sleepy Joe and Obama. It's the highest of any President at this point in his term. No, think of that, 56%. This is as we round the corner on the pandemic, 56%. They were much, much lower. Just remember this, if they were any good, I wouldn't have run for President, but they were no good. They did a horrible job, they did a horrible job. Yesterday, Biden told those 56% of Americans that they probably shouldn't vote for him, and for once I agree with Joe. Did you hear he said you shouldn't vote for me you know? He has no idea what he's saying. How the hell do you lose to a guy like this? Is this possible? Oh, I'll never come to Pennsylvania again. I love this place. You know, they say he was born in Scranton, but he left, he left, he abandoned you. He didn't -- give me a break. [Audience chants ""We love you""] Thank you. I love you, too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, there's a lot of people here tonight, a lot of people. I wish the fake news would show it. They never turn the cameras you know. [Audience Boos] I go home, our great first lady always says, how is the crowd? I said didn't they show -- no, they just show your face and about five people behind me, right? They become -- why don't you show the crowd though? Why don't you do yourself a favor, show the crowd, all right? One of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to abolish fracking. He's a liar, OK, he's a liar. How do you do it? How do you do it? He went for a year and a half. They said, are you? Do you remember the debates with the radical-left Democrats, right? You had Alfred E. Neuman, you had all these people. Do you know who Alfred E. Neuman is, yes? Pete Buttigieg, Pete Buttigieg, he's a bad Mayor of a failed town and he's going to run for President, you know. Pete Buttigieg, but you know he's talking about it. Does that mean everybody? Nobody is going to do, right? That's right. Nobody, nobody, I swear, nobody, nobody, nobody. Then he gets up, I've never seen anything like it in my life and not one fake reporter back there said, well, wait a minute, you've been pledging for a year and a half, no fracking. But then what about the healthcare for illegal immigrants? Who in this group is going to provide healthcare for illegal immigrants? Everybody raises their hand. [Audience Boos] Do you remember, Joe? No, do you remember? This is a famous clip, but they don't ask him questions about it because they're fake. Do you remember, Joe? Who is going to provide -- and look, we all have hearts and we want to take care of everybody. But you know the problem when you do that, we don't have the money. The whole world is going to empty out into our country. They're going to come for healthcare, they're going to come for a college, free college. I say sometimes jokingly, sarcastically, everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce to which CNN says, they don't get a free Rolls-Royce, he has misrepresented. You know, these people are sick. [Audience chants ""CNN sucks""] Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce. They don't get a free Rolls-Royce. The President has misrepresented. Oh, they are sick people but think of it. So, remember when Joe -- and they said, raise your hand if everybody's in favor of free everything, right, free everything. But free healthcare for illegal aliens and Joe goes like, he had no idea what the hell he was doing, folks. He has no clue and he's not a nice guy. You know, just so you understand, not in this guy. If he was a nice guy, I wouldn't hit him like this, but he's not a nice guy. He's a bad guy. He's always been a dummy, but he's always been -- he's never been -- no, no, in his best of years, he was considered a dumb guy. When asked about fracking, Biden said he would sure absolutely make it. We will, uh, eliminate it. That's what he said. Those are the exact words and then he said it 19 different times. Then, one day he said I never said that. It's incredible and they don't question him. I couldn't get away with it for a minute, not for a minute. Did you see the town hall he had with NBC? That was a town hall for a child, a young child, Barron Trump -- actually, Barron is far too advanced for that town hall. That was a town hall -- Lester Holt, Lester Holt, that was a beauty. That was some town hall. That was -- and they said, yes, we have a random sampling of people. Yeah, all Trump haters, right? What a group of people, but he raised his head. He said illegal immigrants will get healthcare. Now people don't realize what that means. [Audience Boos] That means your Social Security goes down the tubes, your country goes bankrupt. You know, the whole thing is a disaster, but he raised his hand. Now he's trying to say he didn't do it and they don't call him out because they're fake. His radical-left running mate who I just watched on television, she is so pathetic, is a co-sponsor of the Socialist Green New Deal, which eliminates all fossil fuels. [Audience Boos] She's having a hard time getting out of that one. Did you hear the other day? She actually came out in favor of fracking. It was like, yeah, I think so. She's further left than Bernie, did you see? Bernie, I thought was the furthest left of the Senate because you don't get too much worse, right? Then you go -- instead of Socialist, you go to the C-word, right? She's further left, she is considered further left. Now, Bernie, this is -- and you know, they look at when Nancy Pelosi does the 25th Amendment, she's doing it for Biden. You do know that, right? Because they want to get Biden out and that won't be hard. But at this very moment, Biden's website includes a pledge to mandate net-zero carbon emissions, which means fossil fuel, coal, everything is gone and it's gone soon, OK? [Audience Boos] And with that goes our economy and with that goes our country. The Democrat party hates fracking, they hate coal, they hate clean, beautiful coal. I've seen what they do with coal now. They hate domestic energy production and Biden will shut you down. He wants to shut you down just like your Governor has got you shut down right now. [Audience Boos] They better open up your state. Did you see the World Health Organization yesterday? They said Trump was right. They said you can't make the cure worse than the problem itself. I've been saying that for a long time and we did the right thing. We saved 2 million lives. They said 2.2 million people, we saved 2 million lives and you know we get nothing. And I'll tell you what, we have -- the vaccines are coming soon, the therapeutics, and frankly, the cure. All I know is I took something, whatever the hell it was, I felt good very quickly. I don't know what it was, antibodies, antibodies. I don't know. I took it, I said I felt like Superman and I said let me at them. No, and I could have been here four or five days ago, it's great. We have great doctors. I want to thank the doctors at Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins and -- one great thing about being President, if you're not feeling 100%, you have more doctors than you thought existed in the world. I was surrounded with like 14 of them. Where are you from, huh? I'm from this one, where are you from? I'm from Johns Hopkins, I'm from Walter Reed, but what great talented people, they did a great job, and thank you. And while I'm President, America will remain the world's No. 1 energy producer with Pennsylvania workers leading the way and that's what's happening. You're leading the way. You know you had the best year in the history of your place. It's a history of -- if you look at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you never want to say state, don't ever say state, actually, nobody cares about them. But you know, I'm just saying, Pennsylvania, you've got two of them, you know that, right? The Commonwealth, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I went to school here, probably spend more time here than sleepy Joe, in all fairness. I went to school here, but we're putting our great coal miners back to work. Joe Biden and the Democrat Socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police department, you see that happening, and we've got -- did you see in the debate the other night? I said to him, name one law enforcement agency, just one in the whole country that supports you. He couldn't do it then Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I say, how come you got the $3.5 million from Russia and they bailed him out again. He was choking like a dog but they bailed him out. But they want to dissolve your borders, they don't want borders, they want to have open borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, get rid of your Second Amendment. [Audience Boos] I mean here's one that that's incredible, destroy your suburbs. OK so they talk about the suburban women and somebody said, I don't know if the suburban woman likes you. I say why? But we had this -- I love you, too. They said they may not like the way you talk, but I'm about law and order. I'm about having you safe. I'm about having your suburban communities. I don't want to build low-income housing next to your house, OK, if that's OK? And I ended the regulation, the rule that made the zoning so impossible that you had to destroy your communities. Then then I hear that the suburban woman. I think that the suburban woman and I used to say suburban housewife, I used to take heat, but I said does anybody care? Do you care, I say suburban? No, they're all going, no. Again, the only one cares is them. Trump said suburban housewife, but I didn't say it because I don't -- you learn very quickly, you learn very quickly. But suburban women, they should like me more than anybody here tonight because I ended the regulation that destroyed your neighborhood. I ended the regulation that brought crime to the suburbs and you're going to live the American dream and that's what you're going to do. And remember this, 29% of the people experiencing the American dream in the suburbs happen to be minority and you don't know that, but 29%, and we're doing this for everybody. We're not doing it one way or the other. We're doing it and I ended it. They said, sir, we can amend it. I said I don't want to amend it, I want to end it. It was a horror show and this loser, Cory Booker, is the guy that's going to be in charge of the program. The guy's a stone-cold loser, 1%, he got 1%, he ran. He was going to be great, you know, 1% every week. He was like her down, down, down, they should have picked him, but no, he'll be in charge of your suburban. So can I ask you to do me a favor? Suburban women, would you please like me, please, please? I saved your damn neighborhood, OK? The other thing, I don't have that much time to be that nice. You know, I can do it, but I got to go quickly. We don't have time. They want me to be politically correct. Oh, yes, let's discuss it. Let's talk about it over the next 10 years. No, no, no, no, we saved your -- we saved suburbia in the U.S. I got rid of a regulation that was a disaster and it was very unfair and you've been reading about it for a long time. It's been going on for a long time. It became much worse under Obama and Biden. I got rid of it and I had a choice, my -- even my own people said you'd never get rid of it, sir. I said I want to get rid of it. Well, why don't we just amended it? I said I don't want to amend it, I want to get rid of it, get rid of it, OK? And I think we're going to see that the women really like Trump a lot, that's happened last time, remember? Remember last four years ago? Four years ago, they said women will never vote for him. I said why, am I so bad? They said the women will never vote, then I got 52%. They said what the hell happened with the women? Except this time, see this is much easier because then I was a developer, I was doing great, everything was nice, but I had never done this before. I came in, I said I'm going to rebuild our military, I'm going to cut your taxes, I'm going to cut your regulations, I'm going to get you this, I'm going to get you that, I'm going to take care of our vets. I mean I did things that, frankly, I never even talked about like Space Force. I never talk about Space Force. The wall is almost built. You know the wall is up to 392 miles. It's almost built and Mexico is paying for the wall, by the way. You know that, I've been saying it. They hate to hear that, but they pay. You know, we're putting a charge on when the cars go through and it'll more than pay for the wall. But we have now the most secure Southern border that we've ever had and I want to thank the President of Mexico. They have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border, stopping people from coming into the U.S. illegally. Thank you very much. No, but we did all these things. So this time in theory, it should be easier. But don't forget, I've gone through years, years of a fake witch hunt and now it turned out that they were the guilty party. They were the ones dealing with Russia. They were the guilty people. Think of -- if I didn't have every night on that fake CNN right over there with a light on. [Audience Boos] The light just went off, it just went off. Every time I point to them, the light goes off, it's all right. Keep it off, nobody's watching them anyway. But you know, think of -- I didn't have every night, Russia, Russia, Russia, hey, and nobody's been tougher on Russia than me. What I've done for NATO, raised $130 billion a year from other countries that weren't paying their bills. They were delinquent as we said in the real estate business, they were delinquent, and that goes up to $410 billion. Nobody did that. Obama used to send them pillows maybe from the pillow man on Fox. Did you ever see a man advertise so much? I've never seen it anything -- I've never seen -- the biggest advertiser. I think he's the greatest advertising genius, Mike? He's the greatest advert -- if I gave him our budget, you wouldn't be able to do anything else but watch Trump ads. The pillow man, I tell you, I'd never saw so many ads in my life. Every day it's a pillow, the pillow. Now he came out with a sheet and I'm going crazy, that's all -- that's all we need now is a new sheet. But he's on our side, too, by the way, that guy. He's on our side, Mike. And now, Biden even refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. [Audience Boos] You know, elections have consequences. Winning and losing an election, that's big consequences and we've been winning elections. And they say, well, you know, Trump shouldn't be appointing the new justice because, well, I'm President. In fact, as you know, a lot of your great justices said, no, no, they're appointed. Justice Ginsburg just said recently, not so long ago. No, no, he's President for four years, not for three years. Your point -- now he was -- she was referring to Obama, I think or Clinton or somebody, but wasn't referring to me. I can promise you that. [Audience chants ""Fill that seat""] Oh, don't worry, don't worry it's big though, it's big. You don't have to worry about that. That's much easier than when we build a wall that goes -- that goes for our lot. You know the wall is one of the biggest projects in the history of this country, you know that, right? And we had a party dedicated to the proposition that there will never ever be a wall. There will never -- they know it's the right thing to do and I made one big mistake. I should have come, instead of saying we will build a wall, I should have said we will never ever build a wall. They wouldn't given me so much money, made a big mistake. Oh, a great Congressman over there. Are you guys having a good time, by the way, huh, Mike? He said the voters don't deserve to know and they'll tell you after the election what he's going to do. And you know what I did, I gave you a list of 45 people on that list, every one of them's a star and I gave you a list. Yeah, sit down, everybody just enjoy yourself, what the hell? Look at these people. I didn't even realize you're all standing. I didn't realize you had seats, you're lucky. It's one of the few crowds we provided seats just because it's Pennsylvania, I guess. It's pretty good. If they win, Democrats will pack the Supreme Court with radical-left justices, who will shred your Second Amendment. You can forget about guns, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals and terrorists. To defend our Constitution from this madness, I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Supreme Court and to the court. She'll be a great justice of the United States Supreme Court. She's done so well. I really found it fascinating, too, that -- you know, I don't have too much time. I tried to watch as much as I could. She was great. The radical left is hell-bent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They're enraged and unhinged and they are going crazy. You know, think of it, very many, you know, Presidents never have anybody to appoint. I will have by the end of the first term almost 300 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices. Their heads are exploding. I hope they're happy. They want to cancel you, shame you, and persecute you. That's what they want to do. They want to shame and -- this whole cancel culture thing you know. Now they're after Abraham Lincoln. They don't like Abraham Lincoln. No, he wasn't too good was he? I said this three years ago, remember? When they took it down a couple of statues of people you'd never heard of, a Confederate soldier or somebody else. But I said, oh, really? The next will be Robert E. Lee, the next will be Abraham Lincoln, the next will be George Washington, and everybody laughed, ho, ho, ho, they said the President is so funny. I said I'm not being funny, these people are sick. These people, they want to take away your heritage. And by the way, are there any Italians in the room? OK, well, we are protecting the legacy of Christopher Columbus, OK? You know the Italians are tough. I love the Italians. So they were going to rip down the statue of Christopher Columbus in New York. You saw that, right? And all of a sudden, a group of Italians circled around the statue and they were having pretty tough things in their hands, I must say. And it was amazing how those people that wanted to rip it down disappeared very quickly. So to the Italians, let me tell you, Christopher Columbus will always be here on my watch, that I can tell you. No, I had people the other day that wanted to wish me Happy Columbus Day. They were ashamed. I said why are you ashamed? No, no, say it, Happy Christopher Columbus Day, this is Christopher Columbus Day, it's Columbus Day, OK? So Italians say, thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate it. I like you, too. I love the Italians. They want to punish the middle class, expunge every last trace of traditional values, and replace the American dream with the socialist nightmare and that's what would happen. Just take a look at what's going on in other parts of the world. Biden's agenda, not that he has one, but you know, he does whatever they tell him to do. He got so lucky. She should have gotten out. You know, she was faithful. She would have gotten out, Bernie would have run -- we would have been running against crazy Bernie instead, but I'd rather run against Joe because there's no enthusiasm, there's no energy. One thing with Bernie's people, and you know, we got a lot of people last time from Bernie because they love me on trade. Because they know our country has been ripped off on trade like no country has ever been ripped off and Bernie's people get that and they -- they like us on trade. Biden's agenda would be a catastrophe for seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. Nobody remembers that and the press will never bring it up, but he tried to cut your Social Security, right? Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty in federal healthcare for the illegal aliens, decimating Medicare, and destroying your Social Security. Biden cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about your senior citizens and it's true. [Audience Boos] And let me just tell you this and I say it strongly and when I first got elected, they always played the Social Security card and nothing happened, right? Your Social Security now is better than ever, I haven't touched it. While I am President, no one will touch your Medicare or your Social Security. Under my leadership, we're delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that's what we want, normal life. We want normal life. We'll fully resume and next year will be one of the greatest economic years in the history of our country. It's already happening. How about the stock market? Who has 401(k)s in the audience? Well, I can tell you one thing, I'm getting all of your votes. I'm getting your votes. Your 401(k)s are setting records. Think of it. As we're rounding the turn and we are -- they go crazy when I say we're rounding the turn on the pandemic, we understand it. Hey, I just had it, here I am. You know, it's me, it's actually me. And I could have stayed in the basement of the White House or maybe the top floor of the White House. I could have done that, but I'm the President of the United States, I can't do that. I got to get out and I have to meet people and I have to see people and I know it's risky to do that, but you have to do what you have to do. You know, I'm the President and I can't sit in the basement and say let's wait this thing out. I'm not going to do that and now I'm immune they tell me, I'm immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I'll kiss every guy, man and woman, man and woman. Look at that guy, how handsome he is. I'll kiss him, not, not with a lot of enjoyment, but that's OK. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate the economy with draconian unscientific lockdowns like you're having right now in Pennsylvania with this Governor who is killing you. [Audience Boos] Tom Wolf, Tom Wolf, come on Tom, open up Pennsylvania, Tom, open it up. You know it's going to happen, November 4th they'll open it up, you know that. They're doing it, they want to keep the numbers as bad as possible. Here's the problem. The numbers are going to come out just before the election. So we have November 3rd, the numbers are going to come out and Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's a late voting state. You actually believe in going to a poll because you see all the shenanigans, no, you're a late voting state. And all I can tell you is, when I came here and I said this before, but when I came here, I promised you a lot of things. I've done much more than I promised you, get the best year you've ever had, you're going to have a better year next year. You damn well better vote for me, Pennsylvania. You better vote for me. Sleepy Joe Biden's plan will crush America. And my plan, we're going to crush the virus very quickly. It's happening already, it's happening, almost 90% less mortality. You know the -- the mortality rate is at like 85%. If you had it seven or eight months ago, it was not as good as if you have it now and soon it's going to be perfecto. And I said that the drug that they gave me, I'm going to -- we're going to be distributing it all over the country to hospitals and everything else because I'll tell you that sucker works. That's my opinion. Why do I know? But to me, it works and the people that did it, they're phenomenal people. They've had great success with other vaccines and drugs. Just this week we learned that another member of the Biden family is getting rich off connections to Joe. His son-in-law -- just came out, big story, is cashing in on the China virus pandemic just like Hunter. Where's Hunter? Crashed in on China, what do you think when Hunter walks in and he walks out with $1.5 billion to manage for China. I said to a friend of mine, one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, does that ever happen? He said I'm the biggest guy on Wall Street that doesn't happen for me. Ten minutes, he had $1.5 billion, maybe he's not so stupid after all. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II and we really should get credit for what we've done because I tell you, Mike Pence and all of these people, they have worked so -- 24 hours around the clock. Our early and aggressive action saved as many as 2 million lives. Remember when they said no, no, no, you don't want to ban China, don't ban China. I did it in January. They were talking a month and a half later, we shouldn't be doing it and he called me xenophobic. I said, Joe, give me the definition of xenophobic, please. He was unable to do that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced the fatality rate by 85%. I'm working with the FDA to make the antibody treatments I received and everybody we're going to have -- they're going to be shipped very soon. We're working on an emergency use authorization, very complicated stuff and the FDA has never responded like they've responded to me. This could have taken years. What we've done and we've done it in weeks. I know they came to me on one thing and they said, sir, well, that will take approximately two and a half years. I said, no, it's no good. When do you need it, sir? Next week, tomorrow, how about tomorrow? No, we're pushing them hard, the FDA has been great. To everyone fighting to recover from the virus, I feel your pain because I felt your pain and we will beat this virus together and for those -- who has had it? Who has had it here? Who's had it? Yeah, a lot of people, a lot of people. Well, you're the people I want to say hello to because you're right now immune, you're right now immune or they say that. You know, they hate to admit it because I had it. So in the old days I said, well, if you have it you're immune for life, right? Once I got it, they give you four months. They say your immune you know. Is there anybody else but me, you're immune for life? Through Operation Warp Speed, which is incredible, we'll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, 100 million and the vaccine will end the pandemic once and for all. And remember this because I have the endorsement of, I think, every major law enforcement and minor law enforcement group in the country. We have a lot of Democrats who left their party and they came over, law enforcement people. I can almost tell you by looking -- look at this group over here. I know the law enforcement people, nobody has been better. We had all this surplus military equipment, Obama didn't want to give it out because he said it looked too militaristic. I said, no, I want to save lives, OK? It's defensive equipment. I want to save lives and we gave out hundreds of millions of -- it was sitting in warehouses all over the country, military equipment, and we gave it out. But there's nobody like the great men and women of law enforcement, nobody. But this election is also about -- look at that, whoa, whoa, see? They love you. See that? Wow, I didn't expect that. [Audience chants ""USA""] Oh, that's great. [Audience chants ""USA""] But this election is about law and order. You look at Portland, we keep saying to the Governor, look, Governor, Oregon, I said Governor let us go and we'll solve the problem in 30 minutes. They don't want to do that. You know, they're supposed to ask you to come in. We did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis, except, you know, instead of 10 days, they could've called us like two hours later, but they came in and they lined up and they were not socially distanced. They lined up. You saw that? They came in wearing black uniforms, $250,000 most expensive uniforms. I never saw so many computers on a helmet, but they went in and they had their teargas. So they had their pepper spray, which the other side doesn't want us to use anymore. They said, no, we don't want to do that. These people -- a lot of bad people out there. You know, they're anarchists radical-left anarchists, OK? So they came in, they came in, you saw it, there was one person. I said where are the rest and another one, then another one. Then they started getting off buses wherever they -- all of a sudden, you had one line to line and they just started moving forward, that was the end of the problem. It ended within 30 minutes. It was over, it was over, and we'll do it wherever they want us. We'd love to go into Portland because those guys are bad news. We actually -- you saw we send in the U.S. Marshals, right, because one man, horrible guy, shot somebody right through the head, shot him in the middle of the street, a guy who didn't -- wasn't hurting anybody. He killed him. Two days went by, three days went by, I said why the hell haven't they arrested him? And they knew who he was and we sent in the U.S. Marshals and in 15 minutes, it was all over. That was the end of it, that was the end of it. Biden, Harris, and the Democrat party declared war on our police, OK? And we proudly received the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, including those in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton, and virtually every single police organization that we know. And during the debate, I asked sleepy Joe, I said give me one organization, law enforcement that's endorsing you and he couldn't do it. Then Chris Wallace saved him. Then I said, remember I said so tell me, say the words law and order. Say it, Joe, say it. He couldn't do it, he wouldn't do it, he wouldn't do it. Because you know what? Because he'd be run out of his party if he said the words law and order. Then I think at the end he said like law and order and safety and justice and you know all the stuff. No, no, law and order, say law and order, Joe, he couldn't do it. So we're joined tonight by some real warriors, warriors of a different type, political warriors are OK, too, right? And they're friends of mine, they're great people. Representative John Joyce, John, please. The guy's been around a long time and he fights like hell GT Thompson. GT, Thank you, great. Be careful with your election, I here you're early up 40 points, GT. Another one who's only up about 44 points, a really good friend of mine and he's tough as hell, Mike Kelly. I say GT, Mike, do you need any help? I'll come and help you with this. They say we don't really need help, don't worry. A friend of mine and a great gentleman and he was the first one that predicted that I was going to win this thing, I'll tell you, former Congressman, Lou Barletta. Thank you, Lou. Thank you, Lou. How we doing, Lou? We're doing OK? How do we compare to four years ago? Better. OK. Good. He said the right thing. Anyway, yeah, I think a lot better because we produced. Again, four years ago, I said we're going to do things. Now we've done them all plus additional things. I mean a lot of additional things. I never talked about Space Force, we did Space Force. You know, somebody did Space Force that's like a major achievement for four years. That's one thing -- that's like one thing out of so many other things. So it's one of those things, but I never used to talk about that. And former Chair of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, a friend of mine, a guy that knows more about Pennsylvania than any human being on Earth, Rob Gleason. Rob, thank you. How we doing, Rob? Good. OK, good. He said to me another group came down that didn't want his advice, they came down from Boston and they put events all over the place and he said you're going in the wrong location. Anyway, they ended up losing big, right? But with us, we came to Rob, we say, where do you think the best places are? And we hit and we agreed with you, too. But Rob Gleason's been a fantastic friend. Thank you, Rob, very much for being here. I appreciate it. And with their help and your help, we are delivering for the American people like never before. Nobody's ever done what we've done in three and a half years. No administration's ever done this, the first three and a half years. In my first three years in office, family income increased by $6,000 and that doesn't include energy, which I think is -- you could double it up, more than five times the gains in all eight years of the Obama administration. African-American income grew 9 times more than it did under the last administration. Think of it, African-American income grew nine, not two, not three, 9 times more and these are out of the book. These numbers are out of the book. Real wealth for the bottom 50% grew nearly twice as fast as it grew for the top 1%. Hispanic family net worth increased by 64% in a short period of time, 64%. We added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs and we added 15,000 factories and Obama said you'll never produce manufacturing jobs, remember? You'll need a magic wand. Well, we found the magic wand. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty, including over 1 million African Americans and more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans, and we're doing great with both groups and we love them. We love both groups. Thank you. Those are great numbers. After our tax cuts took effect, wages for the lowest-income Americans grew twice as fast as those near the top. Think of that, you never hear that stuff. The big beneficiary with lowest-income Americans. My policies benefited those who need it the most. After the virus came in from China and we had to change, we had to do things. This came out, it was a sudden horrible thing. China should never ever let it happen. They should have never let it happen. We've seen the smallest economic contraction of any major Western nation by far, and we've seen by far the fastest recovery of any nation. In the past five months, we've created a record 11.4 million jobs, that's American jobs, that's the fastest ever recorded. Job growth has been 23 times faster than the first five months. Think of this, the first five months of the Obama-Biden recovery, 23 times. We cut unemployment rate in half. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half the jobs lost in the crisis. We did it in five months. So we're talking about numbers that nobody can even believe. Homebuilder confidence has reached an all-time high. We're in a pandemic, reached an all-time high, manufacturing optimism has doubled. Consumer confidence, which just came out, has surged nearly 20% and small business confidence is now higher than any time in the entire decade preceding my election. Think of that. And we're rounding the turn on a pandemic. We've spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He made every bad deal in the book. And by the way, if you look at the H1N1, you know, he calls it the N1H1, right? I said no, no H, here's a way you'll remember, Joe. H comes before N. He goes the N1H1, whatever it's called. What was his name again? The Senator, maybe he was a Governor, Romney, Romney. Oh, that's right, it was Romney. It's amazing, you know, amazing and he gets away with that stuff. You only see it, you know, you only see it on the Internet. They never report it. They never report it. They should report it. They're doing this country a great disservice by not reporting it. But Biden supported NAFTA, TPP, and China's entry into the WTO, which is one of the worst things that ever happened to this country. For half a century, Biden twisted his plane into the heart of the American worker. He should not be asking for your votes, he should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a rotten job, OK. He did a rotten job. For decades, our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now, we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. [Audience chants ""USA""] Almost done, Syria were gone except we kept the oil. Does anybody mind that I kept the oil? So we left some troops behind to kept -- keep the oil. With Iraq, we're almost out, with Afghanistan -- 19 years in Afghanistan, 19 years and we're really serving as policemen. It's great to be policemen, but they've got to have their own policemen. They've got to do it themselves, but we're bringing them home, we're down to a very few number of soldiers. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration's Trans-Pacific Partnership disaster. It would have been a disaster. It would have destroyed your automobile industry and others. To defend our steel and aluminum workers, I imposed historic tariffs on dumped goods. Remember when they were dumping steel all over the place? You guys were getting killed, saving those industries from total destruction. And frankly, had the plague not came in from China, but now they're doing well, anyway, had that come in, you would've had a steel industry that would have been at a level that nobody's ever seen before, but it came in. But you're going to be there anyway, in a short period of time. Unless some stupid person comes along and raises your taxes by 4 times what they should be, which is what they want to do. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA agreement into law. Everyone said that was going to be impossible to do and I withdrew from the job-killing Paris climate accord. So nice of them to tell us that we can't use our energy. I was at a court, you know what that was going to do? Destroy our country, that's what that was going to do. If you look at what has happened over the last very short period of time, the progress that this nation has made, you're not even going to believe it and you're going to see it. And you would have seen it had the plague not come in because it was all happening, we were at every single record. But now, we're getting close anyway. The jobs are all coming back and the market is almost going to be topping the market from before the plague and it's pretty amazing, I will tell you. Biden has vowed to rejoin this horrible agreement, a death sentence for your state's energy industry, the Paris accord. It's a terrible thing. Unlike Biden, I know my job is to represent Pennsylvania, not Paris. We're representing Pennsylvania, not Paris. There are a lot of nice people, they could represent Paris. I took the toughest-ever action to confront China's rampant theft of American jobs, you know that. We charge them so much. We gave a lot of the money to our farmers, $28 billion to our farmers because our farmers were targeted, everybody get your money. They did better without even growing anything to be honest, but we got it from China, $28 billion, we had a lot left over that went into the treasury of the United States. To defend American workers, earlier today, I also signed an order to crack down on Chinese counterfeiters and merchants who sell their fake products all over the United States. They put the name Tiffany, Tiffany, got the blue box, everything. Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany, isn't that wonderful, but it was -- it wasn't made by Tiffany. Biden will eliminate by tariffs on China. He's already said he's going to take the tariffs off China. There goes your steel industry, there goes your aluminum industry, there goes everything, allowing them to plunder without consequence. The one constant in Biden's platform is surrender. He surrenders, he surrenders, whether it's China, whether it's Cuba. How about Cuba? How about the deal they made with Cuba? How bad was that one? I ended it. That's why both China and the far left are desperate for a Biden win because he will surrender our jobs to China. China will own the United States if that sleepy guy gets the position, OK? [Audience Boos] And you can forget about Pennsylvania and you know, don't also forget, your streets will be surrendered to the mob. You know, Republican areas are great. They're doing great. The crime is at record lows, everything else. These are the Democrats super liberal Democrat areas. Unlike sleepy Joe Biden, I will never abandon our nation and I will never abandon its values. My goal is not to make friends in the D.C. swamp. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family. In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order, making it official government to buy American and hire American. My opponent has put forward a radical plan to eliminate U.S. borders by implementing catch and release programs and I ended it. Do you know what catch release is? You catch a murderer, you catch your rapist coming across our border and you release them. Catch, catch them and release them and you say, I'm sorry, three years from now, please come back for a court case. Nobody comes back. Imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals, they don't want any removals. This is what Biden agreed to with crazy Bernie Sanders. When you have people that are in this country illegally, even if they're murders, if they're rapists, no matter what they are, you can't remove them. We've removed tens of thousands of people including MS-13. It would mean the total nullification of U.S. borders overwhelming every city in town in America and especially in a place like Pennsylvania. If Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone, and your safety is gone. Other than that, you'll be doing very nicely. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we're finishing that wall. It's going to be built very soon. It's going to be finished. We're going to have the greatest celebration. That was a tough one, that was a tough one. Remember, they said we don't need a wall. They wanted drones, you know drones flying around looking at the people pouring across the border. They wanted drones, they wanted modern technology. You know what I've said often, right? There are two things that will always be around in a thousand years, in two thousand years, all new computers, all new everything. You know you come up with a new computer, you come up with a new chip, three days later, it's obsolete. I would not want to be in that business, but there are two things, a wall and a wheel, right? A wall and a wheel and in a thousand years, two thousand years, it's going to be here. We invested two $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed forces in more than 75 years, Space Force. For our great vets, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. Nobody thought we'd ever get that done. We killed the leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and we took down 100% of the ISIS caliphate. And when I took over, that caliphate was all over the place. It was a mess. We took out the world's No. 1 terrorist and the mass murderer of many American troops, many troops, many people all over the world, Qasem Soleimani is dead. Thank you. He's dead. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. One of the worst deals I've ever seen. That's John Kerry, the guy was totally incompetent. That guy didn't know what the hell he was doing. He gave them $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, 52 years they've been trying to get that. And instead of endless war, we're forging peace in the Middle East. Did you see the deals we made? I actually got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. The press didn't cover it and that's OK. The press didn't cover it, Mike. I got nominated for three Nobel Peace Prizes. I did more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years and that's true. Now Biden is pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a Presidential nominee. He's going to ruin your energy. He's going to ruin your state. The Biden plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions because there's no money. Biden's running mate sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurers. We have 180 million people with great private plans. They want to keep it that way. They're going to outlaw, they're going to get rid of them. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions by more than 700%. He agreed to this. He said that's OK, let them come in. You know, I got the ban, right? Remember the ban? Remember it was a big deal. I got the ban. I said if it's OK, we have unfriendly countries if it's alright with you. They're not coming into our country. I've got the ban. We won in the Supreme Court five to four. I got the ban. He wants to give up the ban. He wants to let people pour into our country, 700% increase, opening the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism. [Audience Boos] I don't want to speak too much, this is wood, this is real wood. I don't want to speak too much, but you haven't seen too many things happening lately, have you? He'll ban school choice, charter schools, and Pennsylvania opportunity scholarships. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. It's so important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And in conclusion, and I love being back with you in Pennsylvania, so many incredible memories really, no, so many. What a night that was, do you remember that night? Donald Trump has won the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Donald Trump. Remember how late? They just didn't want to call it, they didn't want to call it. I said call it already. If I lost it, we were at 98%, we were substantially ahead. If I lost every single vote, we still won. It took them like until 2:00 in the morning before they called. In the meantime, Wisconsin came in, Michigan came in, but they just refused to call Pennsylvania, they just couldn't -- remember? They were crying and they were all screwed up. Over the next four years, we'll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we'll end our reliance on China once and for all. That's already happening. We'll hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities that people don't want. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment. We'll strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless foreign and ridiculous wars. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. And by the way, we've rebuilt our military, I told you $2.5 trillion. We have weapons and equipment, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia. We are the envy of China. We are the envy of everybody. There is no country that has what we have. And I will tell you, when I first came here, one of our Generals, highly overrated, said to me, sir, we have no ammunition. That's where we started and now, we have the greatest weapons anywhere in the world. I just hope to God we never have to use them. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which is already signed January 1st, it kicks in and further reduce the costs of prescription drugs. And I'm talking about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% because of what I've done with favored nations, we're getting the lowest price, Mike. The whole world, we're going down, we're taking these nations, they pay a fraction of what we pay. I said, no, whatever they pay, I want to pay. Why are we paying more than any other nation? We're the highest, we're going down to match the lowest. The drug companies don't love me too much just in case you haven't heard. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security and we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars and we're very close. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania. It's very important. So get your friends, most important election we've ever had, get your family, get your neighbors, and get out and vote. You've got to get out and vote like you've never voted before. Places that we won like Erie, places that we've won, you've got to get out and vote. Because from Erie to Easton, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg, and from Allentown to right here in Johnstown, we stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is this state where our Founding Fathers declared American independence. Think of what you have in Pennsylvania. No, think, who can say that? This is it, what you've done here, what -- the history of this incredible place, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Think of what you've done. It's where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge and General George Washington, don't worry his statues are not coming down, led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our nation was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers mined the cold, worked the railroads, and forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world and you have seen nothing yet. You wait until you see what we're doing. You wait until you see what we're doing. We are making our country greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when your great Congressman come to see me, right? He's great. What a group of warriors, I don't know. With them, I'm not sure I can handle that group, but when they come in to see me in the Oval Office. They'll say, Mr. President, Pennsylvania is not used to winning this much. We gotta slow it down a little bit. And I'll say, Mike, I'm sorry, Mike, you tell the rest of them, Mike, we're not going to slow it down at all. Pennsylvania wants to win more than anybody and this country wants to win. Pennsylvania is going to win. We're never going to stop. We're going to keep on winning. We're going to win so much you're going to love every moment of it, all right. Hey, you know what, you lost long enough. I can tell you that. Many years, where you're factories and your plants left because we had stupid leadership, don't kid yourself. You lost for a long time and now you're winning and you're winning like never before. Open it up Governor, open it up. Because we're one movement, one family, one people, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America wealthy again, we have made America strong again, we have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. Thank you. Get out and vote, vote, vote, vote."
